(It’s also called locally advanced prostate cancer This book will call it regional prostate cancer to avoid confusion between localized and locally advanced.) Cancer that spreads outside the prostate to other parts of the body is called metastatic prostate cancer Early vs. advanced prostate cancer Early-stage prostate cancer has not visibly spread beyond the prostate gland It usually grows slowly and stays within the prostate This is also called localized prostate cancer"

(It’s also called locally advanced prostate cancer This book will call it regional prostate cancer to avoid confusion between localized and locally advanced.) Cancer that spreads beyond the prostate to other parts of the body is called distant metastatic prostate cancer or simply metastatic prostate cancer How does prostate cancer spread Cancer cells use the bloodstream like a highway to travel to distant areas in the body Cancer cells can also spread through the lymphatic system The lymphatic system is a network of organs and vessels that fights infections and circulates a clear fluid called lymph throughout the body A normal and important part of the lymphatic system are the lymph nodes Lymph nodes are small, disease-fighting clusters that filter lymph fluid to remove germs Lymph vessels and nodes are found everywhere in the body Some patients have advanced-stage prostate cancer when they’re first diagnosed Others develop advanced-stage cancer after having treatment for early-stage cancer Can prostate cancer be cured Advanced-stage prostate cancer is usually a life-long disease But treatment can slow down its growth, reduce symptoms, and prolong life Treatments for advancedstage prostate cancer include hormone therapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, radiopharmaceuticals, surgery, and other therapies It’s true that prostate cancer in the advanced stage can be fatal for some patients But in the past few years, improved detection methods and better treatments have been reducing the number of deaths from prostate cancer in patients of all races and ethnicities Many people with advanced-stage prostate cancer continue to live with the cancer and, in the end, may die from something else Scientists have learned a great deal about prostate cancer in recent years As a result, today’s detection methods and treatments work better than those in the past Also, many patients with prostate cancer have more treatment choices now than they had before What’s the best treatment The best treatment for prostate cancer is the treatment that’s right for you Your team will work with you to figure out the therapies that have the best chance for fighting your particular cancer Importantly, your team should follow best practices This book is based on the best practices for treating advanced-stage prostate cancer Best practices come from the latest research and methods at top cancer centers Your treatment team should personalize your care following the best practices Many new tests and treatments are now available for advanced prostate cancer If possible, seek care or a second opinion from a medical center that specializes in prostate cancer"

What does aggressive mean Bladder cancer When health care professionals describe cancer as aggressive, they mean the cancer is likely to grow or spread more quickly than average Bladder cancer is often described by how far it has spread into the muscle layer of the bladder Here, the cancer tumor has grown through the inner lining (urothelial layer) and invaded the muscle layer in the bladder wall This type of cancer is known as muscleinvasive bladder cancer Aggressive can also be used to describe a treatment that’s stronger or more intense than other treatment options Some people reading this book may have already been tested and given a diagnosis of bladder cancer For those who haven’t been diagnosed yet, the only way to make sure you have bladder cancer is to have tests that: h Look inside your bladder (cystoscopy and imaging) Study your urine (urinalysis and cytology) Analyze a sample of surgically removed bladder tissue (resection and biopsy) We’ll talk about these and other tests in Chapter What causes bladder cancer Many people wonder why they got cancer Cancer experts don’t know exactly what causes bladder cells to grow out of control What they do know is that bladder cancer and other cancers start with abnormal changes (mutations) in the genes of cells Genes are tiny parts of a cell that carry the instructions for how cells behave These instructions also control how new cells are made Sometimes, mutations can mix up these instructions This can turn normal cells into cancer cells In most people with bladder cancer, these mutations aren’t passed down in families (hereditary mutation) They happen on their own and only in cancer cells Still, you may have a higher risk for bladder cancer if another family member also had bladder cancer In rare cases, mutations in these genes can be passed down in families This results in an increased risk of getting bladder cancer However, only some individuals with these genetic mutations go on to develop bladder cancer What are the risk factors for bladder cancer A risk factor is something that increases your chance of developing a disease Risk factors don’t necessarily cause bladder cancer But people with bladder cancer often have one or more of these risk factors: Smoking – Smoking is the greatest risk factor for bladder cancer It accounts for about half of all cases Secondhand smoke increases bladder cancer risk, too Quitting smoking, even after diagnosis, can still be helpful Age – The risk of bladder cancer increases as you age Family history – Your risk increases if you or anyone in your family has had bladder cancer Also, people with an inherited condition called Lynch syndrome have a greater risk of cancer in the urinary tract, including bladder cancer Chemical exposure – Some chemicals used in dyes, rubber, leather, printing materials, textiles, and paint products have been linked to an increased risk for bladder cancer How advanced is my bladder cancer Once bladder cancer is found, it’s important to know how far it has grown or spread Bladder cancer advances in 3 phases: Non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer has grown on or in the bladder’s inner layer of urothelial cells, but not into the bladder’s muscle layer Muscle-invasive bladder cancer has grown through the bladder’s inner urothelial layer and into its muscle layer But it hasn’t grown anywhere else Metastatic bladder cancer has spread outside the bladder to other areas of the body Common areas of metastatic bladder cancer include the lymph nodes, bones, lungs, liver, and the inner wall of the abdomen. (Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped glands that transport a fluid called lymph and help fight infection Lymph nodes are found around the urinary tract and all over the body.) Treatment is different for each of these three phases of bladder cancer These phases are further divided into stages, which are explained in Chapter Bladder cancer treatment What’s the best treatment for bladder cancer There’s no single treatment that’s best for everyone The best treatment for bladder cancer is the treatment that’s best for you You’ll work with your treatment team to choose which option makes the most sense for you"

(Ask your care team or go to findageneticcounselor.com) For bladder cancer, the most common germline mutations are found in these genes: CDKN2A, FGFR3, PIK3CA, ERBBIf you have an inherited risk, your cancer might require additional testing or specialized treatment Quitting smoking Smoking increases the risk for bladder cancer People who smoke are 3 times more likely to die from bladder cancer than people who don’t smoke The more you smoke, the greater your risk Your family and friends could also have a greater risk because your secondhand smoke may increase their risk for bladder cancer, too Quitting smoking may reduce your risk of getting cancer and other serious diseases It can also help treatments for bladder cancer work better Key points Tests of your blood and urine can show if something in your body isn’t working right"

(More about intravesical therapy to follow.) Bladder removal A procedure called a cystectomy treats bladder cancer by removing the entire bladder When the word radical is used, it means taking out the bladder as well as nearby lymph nodes If the disease has spread farther, sometimes other nearby organs also need to be removed, including: Urethra Prostate Seminal vesicles (glands that help make semen) TURBT A transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) is a procedure that examines and removes tumors on the bladder wall Part of the vas deferens (a tube that carries sperm away from the testicles) Proximal urethra (part of the urethra that goes through the prostate) Uterus Ovaries Fallopian tubes Part of the vagina Radical cystectomy is the most widely used surgery for muscle-invasive bladder cancer It’s a major operation that involves cutting into your abdomen You’ll need to stay in the hospital for at least several days It may take 2 to 3 months or longer for you to recover Common side effects and complications of a radical cystectomy include constipation, diarrhea, bleeding, bowel problems, infections, and changes in sexual function Talk to your Cystectomy Cystectomy is surgery to remove the bladder A radical cystectomy removes the entire bladder, nearby lymph nodes, and other organs It’s the most common surgery for muscle-invasive bladder cancer A partial cystectomy removes part of the bladder It’s rarely used for bladder cancer. urologist and treatment team about the risks, benefits, and side effects of a radical cystectomy Because a radical cystectomy removes your entire bladder, you’ll need a new way for urine to exit your body So another procedure, called a urinary diversion, is also done at the same time To find out about the 3 types of urinary diversion, see the next page Partial cystectomy A partial cystectomy is a surgical procedure to remove part of the bladder It’s not widely used for the treatment of bladder cancer Fewer than 1 out of 20 people with bladder cancer are eligible for a partial cystectomy It can only be done if the cancer is in a spot that can be neatly removed without taking out the whole bladder Types of urinary diversion If your bladder is removed, urine needs another way to leave your body This requires an additional surgical procedure called a urinary diversion There are 3 types of urinary diversions: Ileal conduit In this urinary diversion, the surgeon removes a section of the small intestine (ileum) to use as a tube (or conduit) The surgeon also creates a small hole, called a stoma, in the abdominal wall One end of the tube is connected to the ureters, much like the bladder was The other end of the tube is attached to the stoma Urine drains from the kidneys and ureters, passes through the tube, and exits the body through the stoma Urine can trickle out of the stoma at any time A small disposable bag is attached to the outside of your abdomen to collect the urine when it comes out of the stoma This is called an ostomy bag (or ostomy pouch) The bag is attached to your body with the help of an adhesive ring The ring sticks to the skin and acts as a watertight barrier Most people find that they need to empty the bag every 2 to 4 hours, depending on how much liquid they drink A closable spout at the bottom of the bag allows the urine to be emptied into a toilet without taking off the bag Neobladder For this procedure, the bladder is replaced with a segment of small intestine that acts like a new bladder (neobladder) Like the original bladder, this substitute bladder is attached to the ureters at one end and to the urethra at the other end"

(It’s also called an Indiana pouch because it was developed by surgeons at Indiana University.) A section of the small intestine is used to connect the pouch to a stoma in the wall of the abdomen A one-way valve, made from part of the intestine, prevents the urine from flowing out of the stoma The stoma can be covered by a small bandage Sometimes the stoma can be made in the belly button, making it much less noticeable A catheter must be inserted into the stoma, through the valve, and into the pouch several times a day to drain the urine A benefit to this type of urinary diversion is that no ostomy bag is needed This may appeal to people with concerns about body image or people who don’t want to worry about the bag coming loose or leaking Intravesical therapy While surgery is done to remove visible cancer, intravesical therapy is used to destroy cancer cells that aren’t visible or are hard to reach Intravesical therapy means putting medicine directly into the bladder It’s done with a flexible tube, called a catheter, inserted into the urethra The medicine flows through the catheter and into the bladder using a process called instillation The two main intravesical therapies used to treat bladder cancer are bacillus CalmetteGuérin (BCG) and chemotherapy Intravesical BCG Intravesical BCG therapy uses a fluid that contains a very weak bacterium (germ) The germ triggers the immune system, causing the immune system to attack cancer cells inside the bladder Intravesical BCG can lower the chance of recurrence (cancer coming back) or getting worse (invading bladder muscle) Intravesical BCG is commonly used for highgrade bladder cancer that hasn’t invaded the muscle layer It’s usually started about 3 to 6 weeks after TURBT, to allow the bladder time to heal It’s given once a week for 6 weeks You should have a full re-evaluation at 12 weeks after starting treatment To prevent recurrence, you might be asked to continue having intravesical BCG therapy This is called maintenance therapy Maintenance therapy involves three intravesical BCG treatments (given in one week) at 3 months and again at 6 months after TURBT You may continue to have maintenance therapy every 6 months for up to 3 years, depending on the risk of recurrence Possible side effects of intravesical BCG therapy include fever, chills, the urge to Intravesical therapy Intravesical therapy is a treatment where a liquid medicine is placed directly into the bladder The medicine aims to destroy any cancer cells that TURBT left behind and to prevent any new cancer cells from forming. urinate, pain or difficulty when urinating, and blood or particles (clots) in your urine Talk to your treatment team about the side effects There may be ways to help lessen these effects If intravesical BCG doesn’t work on its own, a number of other treatment options are available in addition to treatment in clinical trials Ask your provider or another member of your care team about these potential options Intravesical chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a drug used to kill actively growing cancer cells Intravesical chemotherapy is given to treat the cancer and to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence Intravesical chemotherapy can be given soon after a TURBT procedure"

(An open MRI scanner may be an option at some health care centers.) It’s important to lie still during the test to get the best pictures The machine makes loud noises but you can wear earplugs An MRI of the brain or spinal cord usually requires a contrast agent (also called contrast dye or just contrast) Contrast highlights areas in organs, blood vessels, or other tissues to make them easier to see The contrast is injected into the bloodstream through an intravenous (IV) line before or during the imaging test and later flushed out in urine The contrast agent used for primary CNS lymphoma is called gadolinium You’ll have multiple MRI tests throughout diagnosis and treatment An MRI should be done early on if your symptoms suggest a brain tumor It’s also used right after treatment to see how well the treatment worked You’ll have more MRIs during follow-up to watch for any recurrence or new growth CT If MRI is unavailable or not recommended for you, you might have a computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan instead A CT scan uses x-rays to take many images of your body from different angles A computer then combines the pictures to make a 3D image After imaging After the MRI or CT scan, your images will be studied by a radiologist, an expert in analyzing images of the nervous system The radiologist will convey the imaging results to your care team This information helps your team plan what the next steps of your care should be If your imaging results suggest a primary CNS lymphoma, the next step is a biopsy MRI of the brain Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most useful imaging technique for identifying primary CNS lymphoma It’s important to lie still during the test to get the best images Straps or other devices may help you avoid moving Biopsy If imaging scans show something that may be a primary CNS lymphoma, your care providers will want to take a sample and test it A procedure that removes a small piece of tissue for testing is called a biopsy Getting a biopsy is the only way to be certain that you have cancer A biopsy also gives your care team clues on how to treat it The standard method for diagnosing primary CNS lymphoma is a stereotactic biopsy It’s the recommended procedure when a brain tumor is in a hard-to-reach or vital area It aims to remove only enough of the tumor to make a diagnosis A stereotactic biopsy is done by a neurosurgeon in an operating room First, you’ll be fitted with a frame or several tiny markers around your head to aid the surgery Next, you’ll be given anesthesia to go to sleep A small area of your hair will be shaved down to the scalp The neurosurgeon will then make a little opening in your skull and insert a thin, hollow needle into the brain to remove a sliver of the tumor A computerized navigation system, connected to MRI or CT imaging, will allow the surgeon to target and remove the sample with a high degree of precision After removal, the opening in your scalp will be closed with sutures and you’ll be able to go home What an MRI shows An MRI scan highlights primary CNS lymphoma in the brain People with primary CNS lymphoma may have one or multiple tumors appear on their scan Image: Stephanie E Weiss, MD, FASTRO The tissue sample will be sent to a laboratory for analysis A specialist called a pathologist will examine the tissue under a microscope If the tissue is cancerous, the pathologist will identify the type and grade of the cancer The testing process will take about a week to complete"

(Very rarely it starts in the eyes and spreads to the brain.) If lymphoma occurs in the eye, it often forms in the back of the eye, called the retina The retina converts what you see into signals, which it sends through the optic nerves to the brain Lymphoma cells can also invade the vitreous, the clear gel that fills the eye When primary CNS lymphoma involves the eyes, it’s called vitreoretinal lymphoma Everyone diagnosed with primary CNS lymphoma should have a thorough eye exam This is done at an eye doctor’s office using a slit lamp, a microscope with a bright light You’ll first be given drops in your eyes to widen (dilate) your pupils This gives the eye doctor a better view inside your eyes The eye doctor will use the lamp’s bright light to examine the retina, optic nerve, and other parts of your eyes If the vitreous looks unusual or you have visual symptoms, you may need a biopsy of the vitreous For this procedure (called CNS lymphoma in the eye Primary CNS lymphoma can occur in the brain, the spinal cord, and sometimes in the eyes Everyone diagnosed with primary CNS lymphoma should have a thorough eye examination Here, an ophthalmologist uses a special microscope called a slit lamp to take a close-up look at a patient’s eye. a vitrectomy), your eye is first numbed with anesthetic Then a thin needle is inserted into the eye The needle removes a tiny amount of vitreous, which is then tested for cancer cells In some cases, a vitrectomy alone can confirm the diagnosis of primary CNS lymphoma without the need for brain biopsy Lumbar puncture A lumbar puncture (also called a spinal tap) is a procedure that removes a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for testing CSF is a liquid that flows in and around the hollow areas in the brain and spinal cord This fluid protects and nourishes the central nervous system Testing the CSF can help confirm a diagnosis of primary CNS lymphoma Testing also provides other helpful information needed for planning treatment A lumbar puncture is done only if it can be performed safely and it won’t delay treatment If cancer cells are found in the spinal fluid, or if you’re having symptoms, another MRI may be needed to find out if there are any lesions in the spine Lumbar puncture Cancer cells in the spinal fluid may or may not cause symptoms A lumbar puncture is used to learn whether cancer has spread to the spinal cord First, the lower back is numbed Then a long, thin needle is inserted into the lower part of the spinal column to remove cerebrospinal fluid The fluid is then sent to a lab for testing"

(An open MRI scanner may be an option at some health care centers.) It’s important to lie still during the test to get the best pictures You may be given a padded head brace or other devices to help you stay motionless The machine makes loud noises but you can wear earplugs and listen to music You’ll have multiple MRI tests throughout diagnosis and treatment MRI is also used after treatment to see how well the treatment worked You’ll have more MRIs during followup to watch for any recurrence or new growth CT If MRI is unavailable or not recommended for you, you might have a computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan instead A CT scan uses x-rays to take many images of your body from different angles A computer then combines the pictures to make a 3D image After imaging After the MRI or CT scan, your images will be studied by a radiologist, an expert in analyzing images of the nervous system The radiologist will convey the imaging results to your care team This information helps your team plan what the next steps of your care should be If your images seem to show a glioma, the next step may be a biopsy Biopsy If imaging scans show something that may be a glioma, your care providers will usually want to take a sample and evaluate it A surgical procedure that removes a small piece of tissue for testing is called a biopsy Getting a biopsy of a tumor is the only way to get an accurate diagnosis of your condition A biopsy also gives your care team clues on how to treat your tumor A surgical procedure called a resection does double duty as both a biopsy and a treatment In a resection, your neurosurgeon will attempt to remove the entire tumor or as much of the tumor as safely possible Removing the tumor could relieve symptoms and help you live longer Also, a large sample of the tumor can give the most complete pathology results Sometimes a resection isn’t possible This happens when the glioma is in a difficult place to reach or is located in a vital part of the brain In these cases, your provider will schedule a standard biopsy There are 2 types of standard biopsies for gliomas: stereotactic biopsy and open biopsy Stereotactic biopsy This is a very precise procedure that’s often used when a brain tumor is in a hard-to-reach or vital area It aims to remove only enough of the tumor to make a diagnosis A stereotactic biopsy is done by a neurosurgeon in an operating room First, you’ll be fitted with a frame or several tiny markers around your head to aid the surgery Next, you’ll be given anesthesia to go to sleep A small area of your hair will be trimmed down to the scalp The neurosurgeon will then make a little opening in your skull and insert a thin, hollow needle into the brain to remove a sliver of the tumor A computerized navigation system, connected to MRI or CT imaging, will allow the surgeon to target and remove the sample with a high degree of precision After removal, the opening in your scalp will be closed with sutures You may be able to go home the next day"
