imaging, will allow the surgeon to target and remove the sample with a high degree of precision After removal, the opening in your scalp will be closed with sutures You may be able to go home the next day Open biopsy Like a resection, an open biopsy is a surgical procedure that involves making a small opening in the skull (craniotomy) First, you\u2019ll be given anesthesia that will let you sleep through the procedure Your neurosurgeon will cut open a section of your scalp and then remove a piece of skull bone Using small surgical knives and other special instruments, the neurosurgeon will carefully remove a piece or pieces of the tumor The segment of skull bone will be replaced and the incision will be sewn up Lab testing After either type of biopsy, the tissue sample will be sent to a laboratory for analysis A specialist called a neuropathologist will examine the tissue under a microscope Sometimes, the sample is taken straight to the neuropathologist while you\u2019re still in the operating room The neuropathologist will perform an analysis right away and send the results back to the neurosurgeon The results will say whether the tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (not cancerous) The results may also include the preliminary diagnosis, including the type and grade of the glioma Knowing the preliminary diagnosis during your surgery helps the neurosurgeon to decide how much of the tumor to remove The neuropathologist will also do molecular (genetic) testing, which indicates the type and growth rate of your glioma and other specific features All this information will help your treatment team figure out the best treatment plan for you If your hospital or medical center doesn\u2019t have a neuropathologist, you can ask to have your biopsy sent to one Stereotactic biopsy A stereotactic biopsy is needed to diagnose a glioma tumor In this procedure, a thin, hollow needle is inserted into the brain to remove a sliver of the tumor The sample is sent to a lab to be tested for cancer cells Your tumor type If molecular testing was performed on your biopsy sample, the pathology report should reveal your tumor type It\u2019s important to identify the exact type of tumor you have to predict the course of your disease and plan your treatment There are 3 ways to classify a glioma: Histology \u2013 The first way to classify the tumor is by looking at it under a microscope This is called histology For instance, a glioma with cells that look like astrocytes is likely to be an astrocytoma Grade \u2013 Another way to classify a tumor is by grade, which is a rating of how abnormal its cells are The more abnormal its cells, the faster and farther the tumor is likely to grow Biomarkers \u2013 A glioma is also identified by its biomarkers A biomarker is a molecular characteristic such as a genetic mutation Each type of glioma has its own biomarker or set of biomarkers For example, an astrocytoma may have a mutation in the IDH gene So it would be called an astrocytoma IDH-mutant When these 3 classifications are put together, it provides a full description of the glioma For example, an \u201castrocytoma IDH-mutant grade 2\u201d names its cell type (astrocytoma), its biomarker (IDH-mutant), and its growth rate (grade 2) Let\u2019s look at each of these classifications in turn Histology Histology means evaluating the structure of cells or tissues under a microscope A neuropathologist does a histologic analysis when inspecting tissue from a biopsy The neuropathologist will examine the tumor cells to classify the disease The neuropathologist\u2019s report will state if the tumor started in the central nervous system or elsewhere If the tumor is a glioma, the cell type will be noted in the report The types of gliomas are named after the glial cells that they resemble The neuropathologist can see this under the microscope For example, an astrocytoma looks like cells called astrocytes And an oligodendroglioma looks like oligodendrocytes. 66 Brain tumors are insidious because the symptom burden can feel like an attack on the very nature of the self, including personality changes, language and memory impairment, physical impairment, and poor prognosis.\u201d Grade Another way that gliomas are classified is by grade The grade indicates how quickly the glioma is likely to grow and spread", "extracted_entities":

not be appropriate for some people who have connective tissue diseases, such as lupus or scleroderma The same area generally should not be treated with radiation more than once When CSCC grows in a radiated area, it usually needs to be removed with surgery However, the area often doesn\u2019t heal as well because the tissues were weakened by the radiation This is especially true for CSCC on the scalp A radiation oncologist should help you determine whether this treatment is appropriate for you Adjuvant therapy refers to therapy that is given after primary treatment to lower the risk that cancer will come back Radiation is sometimes used as adjuvant therapy after surgery to kill any remaining cancer cells, or to help prevent recurrence for patients with high-risk tumors Side effects of radiation therapy The most common short-term side effects of radiation are skin redness, itching, mild discomfort, and feeling tired These side effects are worse at the end of the radiation course and take several weeks to go away Potential long-term side effects of radiation include hardening of the skin and soft tissue in the treatment area, mild change in skin color (lightening or darkening), and spider veins More serious long-term side effects include non-healing ulcers and cataracts (for CSCC in the eye area) If you are treated with radiation, you could develop a second cancer in the treated area, but this is rare This is more common in young patients many years (decades) later Systemic therapy Systemic therapy is treatment with medicine(s) that travel in the bloodstream to reach cells throughout the body Systemic therapies can affect both cancer cells and normal cells, and they can have side effects They are given intravenously (through the veins) or taken by mouth as a pill Categories of systemic therapy are described below Chemotherapy Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill fast-growing cancer cells Some chemotherapy medicines contain the metal platinum Cisplatin and carboplatin are platinum chemotherapies used to treat squamous cell skin cancer and other cancers They may be given in combination with other chemotherapy drugs Targeted therapy Targeted therapies are medicines that can target and attack specific types of receptors on cancer cells The targeted therapies used to treat squamous cell skin cancer are known as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors EGFR is a protein found on the surface of cells that causes them to divide Inhibiting (blocking) EGFR may keep cancer cells from growing Cetuximab (Erbitux) is an EGFR inhibitor used to treat CSCC and other cancers Immunotherapy Immunotherapy stimulates the activity of the immune system, which can improve the body\u2019s ability to find and destroy cancer cells Immunotherapies used to treat CSCC and other cancers are known as programmed death ligand 1 (PD-1) inhibitors PD-1 inhibitors are a type of immune checkpoint inhibitor Cemiplimab (Libtayo) and pembrolizumab (Keytruda) are PD-1 inhibitors used to treat squamous cell skin cancer and other cancers Uses for systemic therapy Systemic therapy is not often used by itself to treat squamous cell skin cancer It may be used in combination with radiation therapy to treat CSCC that can\u2019t be removed using surgery Systemic therapy alone may also be an option if both surgery and radiation therapy are not possible or were not successful In this case, immunotherapy with a PD-1 inhibitor is preferred Side effects of systemic therapy If you are prescribed systemic therapy, you may experience side effects The side effects of systemic therapy vary greatly depending on the medicine(s) used Most side effects start when treatment starts and stop when it\u2019s over, but some can occur months or even years later Common side effects include: Tiredness and muscle fatigue Nausea/vomiting Loss of appetite Head and body aches Diarrhea or constipation More severe side effects include lung and breathing problems, damage to

is the most useful imaging test for identifying a glioma MRI scans are good at showing the soft tissues, including the brain, as well as other details that help plan surgery. 66 Fatigue is more than just being tired It can be physical, cognitive, or emotional It can be created from external sources, such as noise, or internal sources, such as medication, not eating properly, or not getting enough exercise.\u201d MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to take pictures of the inside of the body During an MRI, you\u2019ll lie on a table that slides into the scanning machine. (An open MRI scanner may be an option at some health care centers.) It\u2019s important to lie still during the test to get the best pictures You may be given a padded head brace or other devices to help you stay motionless The machine makes loud noises but you can wear earplugs and listen to music You\u2019ll have multiple MRI tests throughout diagnosis and treatment MRI is also used after treatment to see how well the treatment worked You\u2019ll have more MRIs during followup to watch for any recurrence or new growth CT If MRI is unavailable or not recommended for you, you might have a computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan instead A CT scan uses x-rays to take many images of your body from different angles A computer then combines the pictures to make a 3D image After imaging After the MRI or CT scan, your images will be studied by a radiologist, an expert in analyzing images of the nervous system The radiologist will convey the imaging results to your care team This information helps your team plan what the next steps of your care should be If your images seem to show a glioma, the next step may be a biopsy Biopsy If imaging scans show something that may be a glioma, your care providers will usually want to take a sample and evaluate it A surgical procedure that removes a small piece of tissue for testing is called a biopsy Getting a biopsy of a tumor is the only way to get an accurate diagnosis of your condition A biopsy also gives your care team clues on how to treat your tumor A surgical procedure called a resection does double duty as both a biopsy and a treatment In a resection, your neurosurgeon will attempt to remove the entire tumor or as much of the tumor as safely possible Removing the tumor could relieve symptoms and help you live longer Also, a large sample of the tumor can give the most complete pathology results Sometimes a resection isn\u2019t possible This happens when the glioma is in a difficult place to reach or is located in a vital part of the brain In these cases, your provider will schedule a standard biopsy There are 2 types of standard biopsies for gliomas: stereotactic biopsy and open biopsy Stereotactic biopsy This is a very precise procedure that\u2019s often used when a brain tumor is in a hard-to-reach or vital area It aims to remove only enough of the tumor to make a diagnosis A stereotactic biopsy is done by a neurosurgeon in an operating room First, you\u2019ll be fitted with a frame or several tiny markers around your head to aid the surgery Next, you\u2019ll be given anesthesia to go to sleep A small area of your hair will be trimmed down to the scalp The neurosurgeon will then make a little opening in your skull and insert a thin, hollow needle into the brain to remove a sliver of the tumor A computerized navigation system, connected to MRI or CT

x-rays During a mammogram, the breast is pressed between two plates while you stand in different positions Multiple -rays will be taken A computer combines the -rays to make detailed pictures Screening mammograms are done on a regular basis when there are no signs or symptoms of breast cancer Results take a few days Diagnostic mammograms are used for those who have symptoms such as a lump, pain, nipple thickening or discharge, or whose breasts have changed shape or size Diagnostic mammograms are also used to take a closer look at an abnormal area found in a screening mammogram A radiologist will evaluate the diagnostic mammogram while you wait so if additional testing is needed, it can be done right away Both types of mammograms use low dose x-rays to examine the breast They may use either the standard 2-dimensional (2D) digital mammography or 3-dimensional (3D) mammograms known as tomosynthesis. might not be used if you have a serious allergy or if your kidneys

body and if they are using sugar produced by your body to grow Cancer cells show up as bright spots on PET scans However, not all tumors will appear on a PET scan Also, not all bright spots are cancer It is normal for the brain, heart, kidneys, and bladder to be bright on PET Inflammation or infection can also show up as a bright spot When a PET scan is combined with CT, it is called a PET-CT scan It may be done with one or two machines depending on the cancer center Sodium fluoride PET-CT A sodium fluoride PET-CT might be used instead of a bone scan In this test, the radiotracer is made of sodium fluoride FDG PET-CT An FDG PET-CT uses a radiotracer called F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) It is made of fluoride and a simple form of sugar called glucose You cannot eat or drink for at least 4 hours before the scan This scan is most helpful when other imaging results are unclear It may help find cancer in lymph nodes and distant sites If it clearly shows cancer in the bone, a bone scan and sodium fluoride PET-CT may not be needed FDG PET-CT can be done at the same time as a CT used for diagnosis FES PET-CT FES is a radioactive form of the hormone estrogen It might be used instead of FDG PET-CT when cancer is estrogen receptorpositive Inflammatory breast cancer can be difficult to diagnose Ask for a referral to a breast specialist, if possible Ultrasound An ultrasound (US) uses high-energy sound waves to form pictures of the inside of the body This is similar to the sonogram used for pregnancy A wand-like probe (transducer) will be held and moved on your bare breast using gel It may also be placed below your armpit Ultrasound is painless and does not use x-rays, so it can be repeated as needed Ultrasound is good at showing small areas of cancer that are near the skin

point mutation Amplification \u2013 When a part or whole chromosome or gene is increased (for example, duplicated) Deletion \u2013 When part of a chromosome or gene is missing such as del(5q)

changed Chromosome translocation and gene rearrangement \u2013 Switching of parts between 2 chromosomes When described at the chromosome level, it is called a translocation When described at the gene level, it is called rearrangement For example, the chromosome translocation is written as t(8;21)(q22;q1) and its gene rearrangement is written as RUNX1::RUNX1T Leukemia predisposition syndromes Some hereditary cancer syndromes can be passed down from biological parent to child A family history of leukemia can affect treatment A skin punch biopsy might be done if a predisposition condition is suspected If your blood was tested at diagnosis, you would see the genetic changes of the leukemia However, these may not be the genetic changes you were born with Therefore, a skin punch biopsy is used In this procedure, a small piece of skin and connective tissue is removed to get DNA that hasn\u2019t been altered by AML This will be used to see if you inherited genes that increase your risk of leukemia Leukemia predisposition syndrome can affect how your body responds to treatment Blood and saliva can be used when AML cells disappear (in remission) Biological family members who are possible hematopoietic cell donors might be tested for leukemia predisposition syndrome Testing of cells not affected by your leukemia (like skin) can help tell if you have a leukemia predisposition syndrome AML mutation testing Mutation testing using methods such as karyotype (or cytogenetics), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), next-generation sequencing (NGS), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) look for changes or abnormalities that are unique to AML cells (genes and chromosomes) A sample of your blood or bone marrow will be used to see if the AML cancer cells have any specific mutations Some mutations may determine the type of treatment given FISH Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a method that involves special dyes called probes that attach to pieces of DNA FISH can look for changes (abnormalities) that are too small to be seen with other methods It can only be used for known changes Since this test doesn\u2019t need growing cells, it can be performed on either a bone marrow or blood sample Sometimes, a bone marrow sample is needed to get all the information the care team needs to help plan your treatment Karyotype A karyotype is a picture of your chromosomes Karyotype A karyotype is a picture of chromosomes Normal human cells contain 23 pairs of chromosomes for a total of 46 chromosomes A karyotype will show extra, missing, rearranged, or abnormal pieces of chromosomes Since a karyotype requires growing cells, a sample of bone marrow or blood must be used Next-generation sequencing Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a method used to determine a portion of a person\u2019s DNA sequence It shows if a gene has any mutations that might affect how the gene works NGS looks at the gene in a more detailed way than other methods and can find mutations that other methods might miss PCR A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a technique that can make millions or billions of copies of your DNA or RNA (genetic information) PCR is very sensitive It can find 1 abnormal cell among more than 100,000 normal cells These copies, called PCR products, might be used for NGS This is important when testing for treatment response or remission A real-time or reverse transcriptase (RT) is a type of PCR used to look for gene rearrangements such as PML::RARA This aids in diagnosis and monitoring response to targeted therapies Imaging

areas The spread to nearby lymph nodes (N): Has the cancer spread to nearby lymph nodes If so, how many Where The spread (metastasis) to distant sites (M): Has the cancer spread to distant organs such as the lungs or liver Grade of the cancer (G): How much do the cancer cells look like normal cells Biomarker testing: Does the cancer have any genes, proteins such as p16, or mutations that might suggest treatment Staging is based on a combination of information to reach a final numbered stage Often, not all information is available at the initial evaluation More information can be gathered as treatment begins Doctors may explain your cancer stage in different ways than described next Staging includes: Anatomic \u2013 based on extent of cancer as defined by tumor size (T), lymph node status

size and location of the tumor and if cancer has spread to lymph nodes, organs, or other parts of the body It also takes into account hormone receptor and HER2 status Most inflammatory breast cancers (IBCs) are invasive ductal carcinomas This means that cancer started in the cells that line the milk ducts and has spread into surrounding tissue At diagnosis, IBC is stage 3 or 4 disease In stage 3, the tumor can be any size and in the lymph nodes, the lymph nodes can be fixed (or not moveable), or the cancer can involve the skin or chest wall It is sometimes called advanced disease In stage 4, cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastasized) How breast cancer is staged A cancer stage is a way to describe the extent of the cancer at the time you are first diagnosed The American

that you are treated with the standard-of-care approaches Prognostic stages are divided into clinical and pathologic Pathologic stage applies to those who have undergone surgery as the initial treatment for breast cancer Breast cancer staging is often done twice, before and after surgery Staging after surgery provides more specific and accurate details about the size of the cancer and lymph node status Clinical stage (c) is the rating given before any treatment It is based on a physical exam, biopsy, and imaging tests An example might look like cN2 or cM Pathologic stage (p) or surgical

it happened Tell your care team about any symptoms you have Symptoms Each part of the brain has its own job to do Different parts of the brain manage different parts of the body Symptoms occur when an area of the brain doesn\u2019t work properly Symptoms are often related to the location of the tumor in the brain as well as the size of the tumor Symptoms develop as the glioma grows against, or weaves itself into, a part of the brain This growth can cause swelling (edema) in the brain tissue around the tumor Sometimes a tumor blocks the flow of fluid (cerebrospinal fluid) in and around the brain Some people with low-grade gliomas never have symptoms Low-grade gliomas generally grow slowly and can develop for years before they\u2019re diagnosed High-grade gliomas can cause a range of symptoms These gliomas can grow quickly, developing in months or weeks However, symptoms can also be caused by medical problems other than tumors So for the most accurate diagnosis, be sure to tell your provider and care team about any and all symptoms you\u2019re having, even if the symptoms seem unrelated Common symptoms include: Headaches \u2013 Headaches are very common and often the first symptom in people with a glioma Headaches can be worse in the morning, wake you up in the middle of the night, and occur with nausea and vomiting Seizures \u2013 Seizures are also frequent in people with brain tumors Seizures are often an early sign of a glioma, especially in low-grade gliomas Fatigue \u2013 Fatigue is another common symptom of a glioma Fatigue can be debilitating, frequent, emotionally overwhelming, and not related to how much sleep you get or how much activity you do However, physical activity or exercise can sometimes help Nausea and vomiting \u2013 Nausea and vomiting can be caused by the tumor putting increased pressure on the brain Problems with thinking and speech \u2013 Examples include confusion, memory loss, and speech difficulties Weakness or problems moving \u2013 People with a brain tumor may have muscle weakness on one side of the body, or difficulty with walking or balance Changes in personality or mood \u2013 Changes in behavior, mood, and personality can occur in people whose tumors are located in parts of the brain that control mood and personality Other symptoms also sometimes occur Gliomas can cause vision problems such as blurred vision, double vision, or loss of peripheral (side) vision Sensory disturbances include numbness, tingling, or burning sensations often on one side of the body And high-grade gliomas are linked to

light cystoscopy better Cystoscopy commonly uses a white light to see inside the bladder Some newer cystoscopes now use a blue light When combined with a special dye injected into the bladder, blue light cystoscopy can identify tumors a little more distinctly than white light Another technology called narrow-band imaging also helps detect tumors more clearly during cystoscopy but doesn\u2019t

series of cross-sectional images To look for cancer that has spread beyond the bladder, you may have a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis The pelvis is the area of the lower abdomen located between the hip bones; it contains reproductive organs as well as the bladder and rectum A CT scanner is a large machine that has a tunnel in the middle During the test, you\u2019ll lie on a table that moves slowly through the tunnel Pillows or straps may be used to help keep you still during the test PET/CT scan A PET scan uses a radioactive drug injected into a vein to see where cancer cells are in the body Cancer cells show up as bright spots on PET scans When a PET scan is combined with CT, it\u2019s called a PET/CT scan PET/CT creates detailed images that are useful in certain clinical situations for finding cancer that has spread outside the bladder A PET/CT scan can be done with one or two machines, depending on the cancer center MRI MRI uses radio waves and powerful magnets to take pictures of the inside of the body An MRI is used to get a more detailed view of cancer within the bladder or urinary tract It\u2019s also used to see if cancer has spread to the liver, nearby lymph nodes, or the bones in your pelvis Like a CT scanner, an MRI is a large machine with a tunnel in the middle Unlike CT, MRI doesn\u2019t use radiation (x-rays) An MRI also makes much more noise and takes longer

It can spread directly through the liver It can also spread to an area far from the primary tumor called a distant metastasis Liver cancer most often metastasizes to the lung or bone This is called metastatic liver cancer Inside the liver are blood and lymphatic vessels Cancer can spread from the liver through the blood and lymphatic system The lymphatic system is made up of a network of vessels that carry a clear fluid called lymph Lymph gives cells water and food, and it has white blood cells that fight germs Lymph nodes filter lymph and remove the germs Although possible, HCC does not commonly spread to nearby lymph nodes Risk factors Risk is your chance of developing liver cancer Everyone has some risk for developing liver cancer However, some people are at increased risk Risk factors can be activities that people do, things in the environment, or traits passed from biological parents to children through genes Genes are a set of instructions that tell new cells what to become (for example, heart, liver, and skin) and what to do (make hormones, absorb nutrients, and kill germs) Risk is based on: Those with cirrhosis Those without cirrhosis Known risk factors are listed in Guide Cirrhosis Cirrhosis is scarring of the liver It is a type of long-term (chronic) liver disease where liver cells are replaced by scar tissue If you have cirrhosis, you should be screened for liver cancer Cirrhosis can be caused by: Hepatitis B virus or infection Hepatitis C virus or infection h Alcohol use Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) h Genetic hemochromatosis Stage 4 primary biliary cholangitis h Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency h Other causes of cirrhosis Guide 1 Risk factors for developing liver cancer Those with cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B should be enrolled in a liver cancer screening program Risk factors for those with cirrhosis: \u2022 Hepatitis B virus or infection \u2022 Hepatitis C virus or infection \u2022 Alcohol use \u2022 Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) \u2022 Genetic hemochromatosis \u2022 Stage 4 primary biliary cholangitis \u2022 Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency \u2022 Other causes of cirrhosis Risk factors for those without cirrhosis: \u2022 Hepatitis B virus (HBV) or infection \u2022 Additional risk factors include HBV carrier with family history of liver cancer, Asian male assigned sex at birth 40 years of age or over, Asian female assigned sex at birth 50 years of age or over, and African/North American Black persons with hepatitis B Hepatitis Hepatitis is a type of liver disease Viruses called hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) are spread by contact with blood and other bodily fluids HBV and HCV can cause chronic hepatitis, scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), liver failure, and liver cancer If you have chronic HBV, you should be screened for liver cancer Other risk factors High alcohol use can cause damage to the liver Having NAFLD may lead to cirrhosis in those who drink little or no alcohol NAFLD is seen in those with high weight, diabetes, high cholesterol, or other conditions Diabetes, high weight, or other problems with processing sugar may put someone at risk for liver cancer Genetic hemochromatosis is an inherited condition that causes the liver to store too much iron from food Liver cancer screening Screening helps find disease early before symptoms occur, when it is more likely to be cured with treatment The goal of liver cancer screening is to find liver cancer early in those who are at risk for developing liver cancer Two tests are recommended every 6 months for those at risk of developing liver cancer They include: An ultrasound (US) An alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) test An ultrasound is a test that uses sound waves to take pictures of the inside of the body A blood test checks for the protein AFP An elevated or rising AFP might be a sign of primary liver cancer This is cancer that starts in the liver Follow-up steps after a screening ultrasound may include: If AFP is elevated or an ultrasound finds nodules that are 10 millimeters (mm) or larger, then you will have more tests Nodules are small, round areas of tissue Not all nodules are cancer. h If an ultrasound finds nodules that are smaller than , repeat the ultrasound and AFP in 3 to 6 months If an ultrasound is negative, repeat the ultrasound and AFP in 6 months", "extracted_entities": ["liver cancer",

What\u2019s your stage This chapter explains the different treatment options for bladder cancer Many people with bladder cancer receive more than one type of treatment Together, you and your care team will choose a treatment plan that\u2019s right for you Treatment for bladder cancer is based on many things This includes the extent, severity, and type of cancer It also includes your age, your ability to perform daily tasks, your other health issues, and the availability and affordability of drugs Importantly, treatment is also based on your wishes and preferences There are several ways to treat bladder cancer It\u2019s likely that you\u2019ll need a few different types of treatment over months or years Treatments include: Surgery \u2013 The goal of surgery is to take out the tumor and sometimes the surrounding tissue Surgery procedures range from snipping a single tumor from the bladder lining to removing the entire bladder and other organs Intravesical therapy \u2013 Intravesical therapy involves filling the bladder with a liquid medication that helps destroy cancer cells Systemic therapy \u2013 Systemic therapy is typically an intravenous (IV) treatment that treats cancer anywhere in the whole body Types of systemic therapy include chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy Radiation therapy \u2013 Radiation therapy is a local therapy, which means it affects a specific area of the body Sometimes chemotherapy or another therapy is added to radiation therapy to enhance treatment Clinical trial \u2013 Clinical trials are done to test experimental treatments You may be able to join a clinical trial at any time Surgery Types of surgery for bladder cancer include tumor removal and bladder removal Tumor removal For bladder cancer, a surgical procedure called a resection removes the tumor but leaves the rest of the bladder in place The full name of the procedure is called a transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT, sometimes pronounced tur-bit) Even though it has a complicated name, the concept of TURBT is simple It\u2019s a procedure that removes tumors through the urethra without having to cut into the abdomen The tumor can then be tested to provide a more detailed diagnosis TURBT is done in an operating room in a clinic or hospital You\u2019ll be given anesthesia to put you to sleep The urologist then guides an instrument with a small cutting device through the urethra and into the bladder The instrument is used to examine and remove the tumor from the bladder lining The goals of TURBT are to: Confirm the initial bladder cancer diagnosis Take a sample of the bladder wall to see if the tumor has invaded the muscle layer Remove all the visible tumor After the procedure, most people can go home the same day But you\u2019ll need a few days to rest and recover You may feel pain or burning when you urinate and have blood in your urine for the following 2 weeks or so", "extracted_entities": ["Bladder Cancer", "NCCN.org",

Invasive breast cancer is cancer that has spread from the milk ducts or milk glands into the breast tissue or nearby lymph nodes The breast The breast is an organ and a gland found on the chest The breast is made of milk ducts, fat, nerves, lymph and blood vessels, ligaments, and other connective tissue Behind the breast is the pectoral (chest) muscle and ribs Muscle and ligaments help hold the breast in place Breast tissue contains glands that can make milk These milk glands are called lobules Lobules look like tiny clusters of grapes Small tubes called ducts connect the lobules to the nipple The ring of darker breast skin is called the areola The raised tip within the areola is called the nipple The nipple-areola complex (NAC) is a term that refers to both parts Lymph drains from breast tissue into lymph vessels and travels to lymph nodes near your armpit (axilla) Lymph is a clear fluid that gives cells water and food It also helps to fight germs Nodes near the armpit are called axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) The breast The breast is a glandular organ made up of milk ducts, fat, nerves, blood and lymph vessels, ligaments, and other connective tissue Breast cancer Breast cancer starts in the cells of the breast Almost all breast cancers are a subtype called carcinomas Carcinomas are cancers that start in the cells that line the inner or outer surfaces of the body There are different types of breast carcinoma, most of which arise in cells that make up the lining (epithelial cells) in the terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs) of the breast The most common types are either ductal or lobular Anyone can develop breast cancer, including those assigned male at birth Although there are some differences between those assigned male and those assigned female at birth, treatment is very similar for all genders How breast cancer spreads Cancer cells don\u2019t behave like normal cells Cancer cells differ from normal cells in the following ways Primary tumor Over time, cancer cells form a mass called a primary tumor Invasive Cancer cells can grow into surrounding tissues Invasive breast cancer is breast cancer that has spread from the milk ducts or milk glands (lobules) into the surrounding breast tissue or nearby lymph nodes Metastasis Unlike normal cells, cancer cells can spread and form tumors in other parts of the body called metastases In this process, cancer cells break away from the first (primary) tumor and travel through blood or lymph vessels to distant sites Once in other sites, cancer cells may form secondary tumors Cancer that has spread to a nearby body part such as the axillary lymph nodes is called a local metastasis It might be referred to as local/regional disease or locally advanced Cancer that has spread to a body part far from the primary tumor is called a distant metastasis Breast cancer can metastasize almost anywhere but most commonly spreads to the bone (including spine), lungs, liver, brain, or distant lymph nodes Breast cancer that has metastasized to other parts of the body is still called breast cancer More information on metastatic breast cancer is available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app Key points Anyone can develop breast cancer, but breast cancer occurs more frequently in persons assigned female at birth Inside breasts are lobules, ducts, fat, blood and lymph vessels, ligaments, and connective tissue Lobules are structures that make breast milk Ducts carry breast milk from the lobules to the nipple Breast cancer arises from epithelial cells (cells that make up the lining) in the terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs) of the breast Invasive breast cancer is cancer that has grown outside the ducts or lobules into surrounding tissue Once outside the ducts or lobules, breast cancer can spread through lymph or blood to lymph nodes or other parts of the body Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) has spread outside the breast and lymph nodes

weight Listen to your lungs and heart Look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat Feel and apply pressure to parts of your body to see if organs are of normal size, are soft or hard, or cause pain when touched. h Feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your neck, underarm, and groin Testing takes time It might take weeks for all your test results to come in Please wait to discuss the results with your doctor Family history Your care team will ask about the health history of family members who are blood relatives This information is called a family history Ask family members on both sides of your family about their health issues like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, and at what age they were diagnosed It\u2019s important to know the specific type of cancer or where the cancer started, if it is in multiple locations, and if they had genetic testing Blood tests Blood tests check for signs of disease and how well organs are working They require a sample of blood, which is removed through

kidneys Some possible tests are described next The list starts with more common tests Complete blood count and differential A complete blood count (CBC) measures the levels of red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets (PLTs) in your blood A CBC is a key test that gives a picture of your overall health AML often causes low counts of healthy blood cells, but it can also present

in the BRCA genes, or in other genes that play a role in hereditary cancer Nutritional and digestive tract health Your provider may ask about your diet and eating habits Symptoms of ovarian cancer include bloating, pain in the pelvis or abdomen, difficulty eating, and feeling full quickly These symptoms may cause you to eat less in general, or to eat foods lacking in nutrients Your overall health and nutrition level can have an impact on the success of surgery and other treatment outcomes If you need help planning healthy meals or have questions about your diet, ask your provider for a referral to a registered dietitian or nutritionist Your doctor may want to check your gastrointestinal (GI) tract using an imaging test The GI tract is made of the organs that food passes through when you eat This includes your stomach, small bowel, and large bowel (rectum and colon) An imaging tool called a scope is used to examine these organs A scope is a long, thin tube with a light and a camera that can be guided into your body A colonoscopy is used to examine the large bowel This involves inserting a scope into your anus and guiding it through the rectum and colon To examine the upper GI tract, a scope is guided down the throat into the esophagus, stomach, and small bowel This is called an upper endoscopy Blood tests The following tests are not used alone to diagnose ovarian cancer, but abnormal results may signal health problems General health A complete blood count (CBC) measures the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in a sample of blood Red blood cells carry oxygen throughout the body White blood cells fight infection Platelets help to control bleeding Your blood counts may be too low or too high because of cancer or other health problems A blood chemistry profile measures the levels of different chemicals that are affected by your kidneys, bones, and other organs and tissues Levels that are too high or too low may be a sign that an organ isn\u2019t working well Abnormal levels may also be caused by the spread of cancer or by other diseases This test can also provide information about nutrient intake, such as protein levels This can help guide treatment decisions The liver is an organ that does many important jobs, such as removing toxins from your blood Liver function tests measure chemicals that are made or processed by the liver Levels that are too high or low may be a sign of liver damage or cancer spread Tumor markers A tumor marker is a substance found in body tissue or fluid that may be a sign of cancer Along with other information, tumor markers can help diagnose ovarian cancer and monitor response to treatment A cancer antigen-125 (CA-125) test is the most common tumor marker test for ovarian cancer High levels of this protein in the blood may be a sign of ovarian or other cancers A CA-125 test alone cannot diagnose ovarian cancer Health problems that are not cancer, such as endometriosis and diverticulitis, can raise your CA-125 level Some ovarian cancers don\u2019t cause CA-125 to rise Your blood may also be tested for the following tumor markers These may be found in

of the cancer cells Testing for biomarkers involves analyzing a piece of tumor tissue in a lab or testing a sample of blood The results can be used to determine whether you can join certain clinical trials, and whether you may benefit from specific maintenance therapies Other names for biomarker testing include molecular testing, tumor profiling, genomic testing, tumor gene testing, next-generation sequencing (NGS), mutation testing, liquid biopsy, and precision oncology BRCA and HRD A BRCA mutation is the most important biomarker used to plan ovarian cancer treatment Everyone

height and weight Listen to your lungs and heart Look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat Feel and apply pressure to parts of your body to see if organs are of normal size, are soft or hard, or cause pain when touched. h Feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your neck, underarm, and groin Complete head and neck exam A physical exam will include the head and neck Since the oropharynx is found inside the throat, some parts are not easy to see when you open your mouth A health care provider might use a special mirror or fiberoptic scope to look at these areas Dental exam It is important to tell your dentist about your head and neck cancer and to have regular dental cleanings and checkups Head and neck cancer and its treatment can affect the health of your jaw, teeth, and gums If you need any dental work or procedures, they might be recommended before starting certain treatments Distress screening It is normal to have strong feelings about being diagnosed with cancer, and your feelings can change from day to day and week to week Talk to your care team and those whom you feel most comfortable about how you are feeling There are services and people who can help you Support and counseling are available Many treatment teams include mind and body therapists who can help Dealing with a cancer diagnosis can be stressful and may cause further distress Distress is an unpleasant experience of a mental, physical, social, or spiritual nature It can affect how you feel, think, and act Distress might include feelings of sadness, fear, helplessness, worry, anger, and guilt You may also experience depression, anxiety, and sleep issues Your treatment team will screen your level of distress This is part of your cancer care Eye exam Sometimes, nasopharyngeal cancer can affect the eyes An eye exam might be recommended before starting treatment Endocrine tests Radiation therapy to the head and neck can affect endocrine (hormone) glands found in the head and neck, such as thyroid and pituitary glands Therefore, blood tests to look at thyroid endocrine levels might be done before and/or after treatment Hearing test A hearing test shows if there is any hearing loss, and if so, the

speaking Fine motor skills, such as handwriting or tying shoes, may also be affected Talk to your treatment team about the benefits of radiation therapy compared with the risk of nervous system damage, including long-term problems with cognition Radiation therapy for the eyes Radiation therapy is also used to treat primary CNS lymphoma in the eyes WBRT can be expanded to include the eyes Or the radiation can be focused only on the eyes but at a lower dose With either method, usually both eyes are treated at the same time Possible side effects include vision problems that may be temporary or permanent Radiation therapy may cause cataracts, for instance, which can be treated with a routine operation by an eye surgeon Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is another treatment for primary CNS lymphoma that can be combined with chemotherapy Targeted therapy drugs attack specific parts of cancer cells to kill these cells or to slow their growth and spread Side effects of targeted therapy Because targeted therapy aims at cancer cells while mostly avoiding healthy cells, it may have fewer side effects than chemotherapy Some common side effects include allergic reactions, fever, chills, muscle aches, fatigue, weakness, infections, nausea, and diarrhea These medications may also reduce the number of blood-clotting cells (platelets) in the body, increasing the risk of bruising and

and disease\u2014to fight cancer Immunotherapy treats cancer cells throughout the body The main immunotherapy drug used for primary CNS lymphoma is rituximab (Rituxan) Rituximab is a type of immunotherapy called a monoclonal antibody Monoclonal antibodies hunt for specific proteins on the surface of cancer cells Cancerous blood cells (and some healthy blood cells) have a protein on their surface called CDRituximab finds and attaches itself to CD20 proteins This helps your immune system locate and then destroy the cancer cells Rituximab is given through an IV infusion Side effects of immunotherapy Rituximab and other immunotherapies may cause drowsiness, fatigue, constipation, joint pain, loss of appetite, low blood cell counts, serious blood clots, and rashes Keep track of your

is whether the cancer has the PD-L1 biomarker At this time, preferred first-line regimens for PD-L1\u2013positive cancers are listed below Bevacizumab (Avastin) might be added to either regimen Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) cisplatin paclitaxel Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) carboplatin + paclitaxel The preferred first-line regimen for all other metastatic cervical cancers is: h Cisplatin paclitaxel bevacizumab Pembrolizumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor (a type of immunotherapy) Bevacizumab is a type of targeted therapy called a biologic that is designed to work with chemotherapy Other

specialists, and emotional and spiritual support are all components of supportive care Because metastatic cancer cannot be cured, the main goal of supportive care is to make you more comfortable and to help keep the cancer under control Supportive care may also help you live longer and feel better overall When used for advanced cancers, supportive care is often called palliative care You may also consider enrolling in a clinical trial Ask your treatment team if there is an open clinical trial that you can join Advance care planning Talking with your doctor about your prognosis can help with

some cases, imaging tests may be performed This is based on your individual situation Imaging tests take pictures of the inside of the body to look for sites with leukemia outside the bone marrow Leukemia can spread outside the bloodstream to lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and skin It rarely spreads to the lining of the brain and spinal cord Imaging tests can also show areas of infection or bleeding that may impact your care A radiologist, a medical expert in interpreting imaging tests, will interpret the test and send a report to your doctor While these reports might be available to you

is a substance used to improve the quality of the pictures of the inside of the body It is used to make the pictures clearer Contrast might be taken by mouth (oral) or given through a vein (IV) Oral contrast does not get absorbed from your intestines and will be passed with your next bowel movements IV contrast will leave the body in the urine immediately after the test The types of contrast vary and are different for CT and MRI Not all imaging tests require contrast, but many do Tell your care team if you have had allergic reactions to contrast in the past This is important You might be given medicines to avoid the effects of those allergies Contrast might not be used if you have a serious allergy or if your kidneys aren\u2019t working well Brain CT scan A CT of the brain is used to look

the images are combined to make one detailed picture Contrast may or may not be used This is a very quick test Brain MRI scan An MRI can show if the outer layer of the brain is swollen from leukemia (leukemic meningitis) An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan uses radio waves and powerful magnets to take pictures of the inside of the body It does not use x-rays, which means there is no

radon and asbestos If you don\u2019t smoke, don\u2019t start If you do smoke, quit New lung tumors are less likely to develop after quitting smoking Nicotine addiction is one of the hardest addictions to stop The stress of having cancer may make it even harder to quit There is help Ask your health care providers about counseling and medicines to help you quit What are the symptoms of SCLC SCLC can cause many types of symptoms The symptoms depend on where the lung tumor has grown to or spread SCLC can prevent the lungs from getting the air they need Some people also have symptoms from paraneoplastic syndromes, which are caused by an abnormal body response to lung cancer Some symptoms caused by SCLC are listed in Guide SCLC is often found when it\u2019s causing symptoms or routine blood tests are abnormal Less often, it\u2019s found in x-rays or CT scans before symptoms start Unlike other lung cancers, it\u2019s difficult to detect SCLC early because it grows more quickly Airways of the lungs Air moves through your body in a series of airways It travels down your throat and through the windpipe (trachea) The windpipe splits into 2 airways called bronchi Inside the lung, each bronchus branches off into the parts of the lung, called lobes The right lung has 3 lobes, and the left lung has 2 lobes The bronchi divide into smaller airways called the bronchioli At the

in the surface layer of tissue surrounding the ovaries, called the epithelium These cancers can also start in the fallopian tube, close to where the tube meets the ovary This guide provides treatment recommendations for common and rare ovarian cancers The ovaries The ovaries are part of the female reproductive system In addition to the 2 ovaries, this system includes the fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and vagina The ovaries make eggs needed for sexual reproduction They also release hormones that affect breast growth, body shape, and the menstrual cycle (periods) Each ovary is about the size and shape of a grape One is on the left side of the uterus and the other is on the right Each is surrounded by a long, thin tube called a fallopian tube After an egg is pushed out by the ovary, it is caught by the fallopian tube and travels into the uterus Here the fetus grows and develops during pregnancy If the egg is not fertilized, this leads to a period The uterus and at least 1 ovary and fallopian tube are needed for menstruation and pregnancy The female reproductive system The female reproductive system includes the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and vagina Types of ovarian cancer Most ovarian cancers are found in the outer surface of the ovaries, called the epithelium There are more than 5 types of epithelial ovarian cancer The most common forms are: High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) High-grade endometrioid carcinoma Less common ovarian cancers Rare types of ovarian cancer are called less common ovarian cancers (LCOCs) or less common ovarian histologies (LCOHs) They can start in the epithelium, in tissues that support the ovaries, or in the reproductive (egg) cells of the ovary Less common epithelial ovarian cancers include: Low-grade serous carcinoma Low-grade endometrioid carcinoma Carcinosarcoma (also called malignant mixed Mullerian tumors) Clear cell carcinoma Mucinous carcinoma Borderline epithelial tumor (also called low malignant potential tumors) Less common non-epithelial ovarian cancers include: Malignant sex-cord stromal tumors Malignant germ cell tumors Primary peritoneal cancer Primary peritoneal cancer forms in the the tissue that lines the abdominal wall and covers the abdominal organs The treatment information in this guide also applies to primary peritoneal cancer and fallopian tube cancer How is the type determined To diagnose ovarian cancer and determine the cancer type, tumor tissue needs to be removed from your body and tested If surgery is planned first, the tumor and other tissues removed during surgery will be tested If chemotherapy is planned first, a biopsy will be performed to remove a sample of the tumor A physician expert called a pathologist determines the type of ovarian cancer by examining the cancerous tissue The pathologist also determines the cancer grade The grade is a rating of how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope High-grade cancers grow and spread more quickly than low-grade cancers The cancer grade is different than the stage Stages are categories that describe where the cancer has or hasn't spread from the ovary Surgery is needed in order to know

like feeding yourself or bathing Your oncologist will score your performance status based on your health history and exam Blood tests Blood tests can measure blood cells, proteins, and chemicals in the bloodstream If you haven\u2019t had a blood test recently, you\u2019ll get a complete blood count (CBC) with differential A CBC measures parts of the blood including counts of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. h A differential counts the most common types of white blood cells in your blood It also checks if the cell counts are in balance with each other White blood cell counts are often high at diagnosis of CLL Other blood counts, such as red blood cells or platelets, may be low A comprehensive metabolic panel is a screening test for many diseases It often includes tests for up to 14 chemicals in the blood Abnormal levels may mean your kidneys and liver are not working as they should Beta-2 microglobulin is a small protein found on most cells It is released by cells into the blood by B cells High levels of beta-2 microglobulin may suggest CLL is growing Bone marrow tests Bone marrow tests are not often needed to diagnose CLL However, they may be done to find out what\u2019s causing low blood cell counts Biomarker tests CLL cells have unique features that can be used to plan treatment specifically for you These features are called biomarkers Biomarkers are found with lab tests using either a blood or bone marrow sample: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can show missing parts and extra copies of genetic material called chromosomes It can detect a biomarker called 17p deletion DNA sequencing is used to look for mutations in the TP53 and IGHV genes, which control how your cells die when they\u2019re not healthy A karyotype can show defects in chromosomes A complex karyotype is 3 or more unrelated changes or deletions in more than one cell Biomarkers used to select treatment are discussed in Chapter 4: Treatment for CLL Diagnostic CT Computed tomography, or CT, is like an x-ray but it shows body tissue more clearly A diagnostic CT uses more radiation than regular CT and adds a contrast agent Some people refer to this as a CAT scan A contrast agent is a chemical that highlights body tissues for the scanner It\u2019s given to you through a needle placed into a vein in your arm Some people can\u2019t have contrast due to certain health issues, like allergies or chronic kidney disease Ask if contrast is safe for you A diagnostic CT of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis may be needed for 2 reasons: To look for big lymph nodes that may be causing symptoms To assess the extent of the cancer before starting treatment Since a CT scan is often not needed, you should ask your doctor what the reason is to obtain the test A CT scan is done in the radiology department, in a big machine that looks like a tunnel The scan won\u2019t hurt, but if you need contrast you will need to get a needle placed in your arm A radiologist will review your scans and send the results to your oncologist. 66 I am so grateful I had a consultation with a CLL specialist It was reassuring to finally speak to a CLL specialist The

are nonmetastatic, meaning the cancer has not spread beyond the pelvis See page 26 for information on metastatic anal cancer Chemoradiation Chemoradiation is the recommended primary (main) treatment for non-metastatic anal canal cancer Chemoradiation involves treatment with both chemotherapy and radiation therapy during the same time period More information on this combined treatment approach is provided next Radiation therapy Radiation therapy most often uses highenergy x-rays to kill cancer cells An advanced radiation technique called intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is the preferred method for treating anal cancer It is a type of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) In EBRT, radiation is delivered from outside (external to) the body using a large machine Anal canal cancer (stages I \u2013 III) called a linear accelerator The radiation passes through skin and other tissue to reach the tumor All types of EBRT are conformal, which means that the radiation beams are shaped to the tumor What makes IMRT unique compared to other forms of EBRT is that it uses many small beams of different intensities (strengths) This allows a high dose of radiation to be targeted at the tumor while limiting the amount of radiation to the surrounding normal tissue With IMRT it is possible to reduce radiation to important nearby organs and structures, such as external genitalia and hip joints This can help reduce treatment-related side effects Radiation therapy is given in small doses, called fractions As part of chemoradiation for anal cancer, radiation is typically given Monday through Friday for 5 to 6 weeks (25 to 30 treatment sessions) A planning session, called simulation, is needed before treatment begins If IMRT is planned, you will most likely lie on your back with your knees out to the side (\u201cfrog-legged\u201d) for simulation and for treatment Pictures of the cancer sites will be obtained with a CT scan Using the pictures and sophisticated computer software, the radiation team will plan the best radiation dose and number of treatments During treatment, you will lie on a table as you did for simulation Devices may be used to keep you from moving This helps to target the tumor Ink marks on your skin will help position your body accurately for daily treatments Your radiation oncologist will devise a treatment plan to aim radiation beams at the anal tumor and lymph nodes in the pelvis and groin You will be alone in the treatment room A technician will operate the machine from a nearby room The technician will be able to see, hear, and speak with you at all times As treatment is given, you may hear noises You will not see, hear, or feel the radiation One session can take less than 10 minutes Common side effects at the treatment site during the 5 to 6 weeks of radiation treatment include skin irritation, tenderness, redness, and sores or skin breakdown Discuss the use of over-the-counter ointments with your radiation oncologist Over-the-counter ointments like Aquaphor or Silvadene can soothe the skin and help with healing Other short-term side effects of radiation therapy include diarrhea, fatigue, frequent urination or pain while urinating, and nausea Most of these decrease over time when treatment is over Radiation therapy side effects may not be felt immediately They can appear and worsen later in the cycle or even after it is complete Radiation therapy for anal cancer can also have long-term and potentially serious side effects on fertility, sexual health, and bowel and bladder function See \u201cFertility and family planning\u201d on page 14 and Part 3: Survivorship for information on ways to help prevent, limit, or manage these effects Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer medicines It is a type of systemic therapy Most commonly, chemotherapy is given intravenously This means the medicine(s) are slowly infused into the body through a vein The medicine(s) travel in the bloodstream to reach cells throughout the body Chemotherapy can also be given orally Radiation therapy An advanced radiation technique called intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is the preferred method for treating anal cancer At this time, chemotherapy regimens recommended for use with radiation therapy to treat stage I, II, and III anal cancer include: Mitomycin and capecitabine Mitomycin and 5-FU

Lymphocytic \u2013 occurs in the lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell Leukemia \u2013 cancer that occurs in blood cells Put together, chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a condition in your lymphocytes that doesn\u2019t go away It\u2019s considered a form of cancer Your blood contains several types of blood cells One of those is white blood cells B cells, also called B lymphocytes, are one type of white blood cell They\u2019re made within the soft, spongy tissue inside most of your bones called bone marrow When they've matured properly, B cells leave your bone marrow to work in your bloodstream Why you should read this book Making decisions about cancer care can be stressful You may need to make tough decisions under pressure about complex choices The NCCN Guidelines for Patients are trusted by patients and providers They clearly explain current care recommendations made by respected experts in the field Recommendations are based on the latest research and practices at leading cancer centers Cancer care is not the same for everyone By following expert recommendations for your situation, you are more likely to improve your care and have better outcomes as a result Use this book as your guide to find the information you need to make important decisions In people with CLL, abnormal B cells grow out of control, crowding out healthy B cells This oversupply of abnormal B cells prevents healthy B cells from performing their duties effectively This results in fewer healthy blood cells and a higher risk of infection What are the symptoms of CLL Usually, CLL doesn\u2019t cause symptoms at first It may be found due to routine blood testing Symptoms of CLL may include the following See a health care professional as soon as you can if you have any of these symptoms: Swollen glands in your neck, or you feel swelling in your stomach Feel tired more easily or fatigue Excessive sweating or night sweats Fever Infections that keep coming back despite treatment Loss of appetite or becoming full too quickly (early satiety) Unintentional weight loss What causes CLL The specific cause of CLL isn't currently known other than that there is a change within the bone marrow It can be tied to several factors: Older adults tend to develop changes or mutations that could cause cancer like CLL to form over time Blood relatives of someone with CLL can have a higher chance of getting CLL themselves Lymph system Many B cells are in the lymph (or lymphatic) system This system plays a key role in fighting infections The tonsils, thymus, spleen, and lymph vessels and nodes are parts of the lymph system (shown) There are hundreds of lymph nodes in the body, and many are in the neck, armpits, and groin How is CLL treated Treatment of CLL depends on your body You may not need treatment right away But treatment may be needed if your white blood cell count is rising rapidly, if you have low numbers of other normal blood cells (anemia, low platelets, or low neutrophils), if you have large or uncomfortable lymph nodes, or if you have symptoms listed above Many treatment options are available and should be discussed with your doctor at your first visit and as your condition is followed These range from pills you take every day to a combination of IV infusions and pills taken for a specific amount of time You may live for years without needing treatment If or when someone needs treatment can vary greatly from person to person You may have a more intense or aggressive treatment plan if you develop Richter transformation, which is described later This rare

with testing Accurate testing is needed to diagnose and treat CML This chapter presents an overview of possible tests you might receive and what to expect Organize your medical documents, including insurance forms, medical records, and test results Keep a list of contact information for your care team and update your primary care physician (PCP) regarding any changes Include details about the specific type of cancer, treatment, and dates on your contact list Ask your care team how best to communicate with them, especially in an emergency Test results Results from blood tests and possible biopsy will be used to determine your treatment plan Treatment will be based on these findings It is important you understand what these tests mean Ask questions about your test results Online patient portals are one way to access your test results Keep these things in mind: It's beneficial to have a support system in place during diagnosis and treatment Enlist the help of friends, family members, or peers who can provide transportation, meals, and emotional support These can be different people for different tasks or change over time Consider bringing someone with you to doctor visits if possible, or have someone on the phone or join you for telehealth visits Don\u2019t hesitate to ask questions and take notes during appointments Write down questions and ask a friend or family member

cancer basics What is pancreatic cancer What causes pancreatic cancer What are the stages of pancreatic cancer What is the best treatment for pancreatic cancer Key points Pancreatic cancer is one of the most common cancers It is a challenging cancer to treat, but treatment is improving Experts are studying the best ways to treat pancreatic cancer and are developing new treatments Read this chapter to learn the answers to some common questions about pancreatic cancer What is pancreatic cancer Pancreatic cancer starts in a large gland called the pancreas The pancreas is part of the digestive system It makes enzymes that break down proteins, fats, sugars, and starches in food It also makes hormones called insulin and glucagon that control blood sugar levels Pancreatic cancer affects cell growth Pancreatic cancer cells make many new cancer cells and do not die when they should The overgrowth of pancreatic cancer cells becomes a mass called a tumor Pancreatic cancer cells also don\u2019t stay in place and may grow into nearby body tissue They may break away from a tumor, spread to other areas, and form more tumors There are 2 main types of pancreatic cancer The more common type of pancreatic cancer forms from exocrine cells Exocrine cells make and move digestive enzymes Pancreatic adenocarcinomas form from exocrine cells that line the tube-like ducts of the pancreas They are also called pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and are the focus of this book Pancreas Sounds like PAN-kree-us The pancreas is deep inside the body It sits just below the liver and behind the stomach In adults, the pancreas is about 6 inches long Less often, pancreatic cancer forms from endocrine cells Endocrine cells make hormones Pancreatic cancer that forms from endocrine cells is called a neuroendocrine tumor Information on pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors can be found at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the app NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer What causes pancreatic cancer Many people with cancer wonder how they got it Experts don\u2019t know exactly what causes pancreatic cells to become cancer cells But they do know several factors that increase the chance of developing pancreatic cancer Such risk factors include: Lifestyle factors, such as smoking tobacco, heavy alcohol use, and a less healthy diet Major contact with cancer-causing chemicals, such as pesticides Health conditions, such as diabetes and chronic inflammation of the pancreas Close blood relatives with pancreatic, breast, ovarian, or colorectal cancers or melanoma About 1 in 10 pancreatic cancers are hereditary This means that a higher risk was passed down to you by your parents through your genes The genetic cause of hereditary pancreatic cancer is unknown in most families Hereditary health conditions that are known to increase risk of pancreatic cancer include: Hereditary breast-ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC) Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, Lynch syndrome, and Li-Fraumeni syndrome Familial malignant melanoma syndrome, also known as melanoma-pancreatic cancer syndrome or familial atypical multiple mole melanoma (FAMMM) syndrome Hereditary pancreatitis Genetic tests

Often, stages 1 through 4 are written with Roman numerals\u2014stages I, II, III, and IV The cancer stages are based on the size of the pancreatic tumor and how far the cancer has spread Stage 0 pancreatic cancer is only in the innermost layer of the duct wall Stage 1 pancreatic cancer consists of a tumor that is 4 centimeters or smaller and has not spread outside the pancreas For comparison, a golf ball is 3 centimeters. h Stage 2 pancreatic cancer consists of a tumor that is larger than 4 centimeters or the cancer has spread to 1 to 3 nearby lymph nodes, which are small structures that help the body fight disease Stage 3 pancreatic cancer has grown through the pancreas to nearby major arteries or has spread to 4 or more lymph nodes Stage 4 pancreatic cancer has spread far and commonly involves the liver, lungs, or lining of the abdomen What stage is metastatic cancer Stage 4 pancreatic cancer is metastatic cancer, but other stages may become metastatic cancer over time Metastatic pancreatic cancer has spread far from the pancreas Is staging used to plan treatment for pancreatic cancer Unlike other cancers, experts do not plan initial treatment mainly based on the

studies and biopsy (including biomarker tests) will be used to determine your treatment plan Treatment will be based on these findings It is important you understand what these tests mean Ask questions and keep copies of your test results Online patient portals are a great way to access your test results Keep these things in mind: Choose a friend, family member, or peer who can drive you to appointments, provide meals, or offer emotional support during diagnosis and treatment Bring someone with you to doctor visits, if possible Write down questions and take notes during appointments Don\u2019t be afraid to ask your care team questions Get to know your care team and help them get to know you Get copies of blood tests, imaging results, and reports about the specific type of cancer you have Organize your papers Create files for insurance forms, medical records, and test results You can do the same on your computer Testing takes time It might take days or weeks before all test results come in Keep a list of contact information for everyone on your care team Add it to your phone Hang the list on your refrigerator or keep it in a place where someone can access it in an emergency Keep your primary care physician (PCP) informed of changes to this list You are encouraged to keep your PCP in the loop They are great partners in your care In your contact list, include

airways of the lungs The airways of the lungs include the bronchus, bronchioles, and alveoli Lung cancer screening aims to find cancer early and before symptoms start Lung cancer found earlier is more likely to be treated successfully Lung cancer screening is not recommended for everyone Screening is for those at risk for developing lung cancer Ask your health care provider if you qualify for lung

have symptoms Key points Risk is your chance of developing lung cancer Some people are more likely than others to develop lung cancer Anything that increases your chances of developing lung cancer is called a risk factor Lung cancer screening is based on your risk factors described in this chapter See your health care provider (HCP) regularly for checkups and cancer screenings, which may include screenings for skin, breast, prostate cancer, and other types of cancer You might be asked to see your HCP more than every year based on your risk factors for developing lung cancer As your family health history changes, it is important to keep your HCP updated Risk factors Risk is your chance of developing lung cancer Everyone has some risk for developing lung cancer However, some people are at increased risk Risk factors can be activities that people do, things in the environment, or traits passed down from biological parents to children through genes Genes are a set of instructions that tell new cells what to become (for example, lung, heart, and skin) and what to do (make hormones, absorb nutrients, and kill germs) Known risk factors for lung cancer are listed in Guide\nLung cancer

line the airways of the lungs The lungs' airways are called the bronchus, bronchioli, and alveoli Cancer cells don\u2019t behave like normal cells They break the rules of cell growth Cancer cells make many new cancer cells They also do not die when they should This overgrowth of cancer cells becomes a mass of tissue called a tumor Cancer cells grow out of control They can grow through the airway and into the lung tissue They can grow through the lung wall and invade other body parts Cancer cells can break away from a tumor and spread They can enter the bloodstream or a fluid called lymph and spread to other places This out-of-control cell growth can harm the body Cancer cells crowd out and overwhelm normal cells Without enough normal cells, cancer cells can cause organs to stop working

22 break off and trade places The result is a fused gene called BCR::ABL1 and a shortened chromosome 22 called the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome If you do not have the Ph chromosome or the BCR::ABL1 gene, you do not have CML What is CML Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a type of blood cancer Blood is a tissue A tissue is a group of cells that work together to perform a function Blood\u2019s function is to move oxygen and nutrients throughout your body and carry away waste Blood also plays an important role for the immune system and in preventing bleeding There are 4 main components of blood\u2014plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets Types of blood cells Your blood contains different types of cells that float in plasma Plasma is a clear, yellowish fluid made up of mostly water Why you should read this book Making decisions about cancer care can be stressful You may need to make tough decisions under pressure about complex choices NCCN Guidelines for Patients are trusted by patients and providers They clearly explain current care recommendations made by respected experts in the field Recommendations are based on the latest research and practices at leading cancer centers Cancer care is not the same for everyone By following expert recommendations for your situation, you are more likely to improve your care and have better outcomes as a result Use this book as your guide to find the information you need to make important decisions There are 3 types of blood cells: Red blood cells (RBCs or erythrocytes) carry oxygen throughout the body White blood cells (WBCs or leukocytes), which include granulocytes, monocytes, and lymphocytes, fight infections Platelets (PLTs or thrombocytes) help control bleeding In CML, there are usually too many white blood cells (granulocytes) Sometimes, there are too few or too many platelets, as well Chronic means this cancer worsens slowly Granulocytes include: Neutrophils Eosinophils Basophils How are blood cells formed Bone marrow is the sponge-like tissue in the center of most bones Inside your bone marrow are early blood-forming cells called blood (hematopoietic) stem cells All types of blood cells are created from blood stem cells At any given time, the bone marrow will have cells in various stages of development, from very young (immature) to almost fully mature This process is called differentiation Blood stem cells give rise to red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets (PLTs), which are then released into your bloodstream as needed The role of blood stem cells is to make cells called intermediaries that will become red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets These intermediaries are called progenitor cells or precursor cells There are different types of progenitor cells: Lymphoid progenitor cells form into lymphoblasts that mature into lymphocytes Philadelphia chromosome Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is caused by a single, specific abnormal gene that is created when a piece of chromosome 9 and a piece of chromosome 22 break off and trade places The result is a fused gene called BCR::ABL1 and a shortened chromosome 22 called the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome Myeloid progenitor cells form into myeloblasts and other non-lymphoid blood cells Often, in CML the very immature or most immature cells (myeloblasts or lymphoblasts) are referred to simply as blasts CML is thought to arise from blood stem cells that make an increased amount of myeloid progenitor cells However, an advanced form of CML, called blast phase CML (BP-CML), can cause an increased amount of lymphoid or myeloid progenitor cells The type of blast phase cell will affect treatment in BP-CML What causes CML The cause of CML can be traced to a single, specific abnormal gene called BCR::ABLThis fused gene occurs when a piece of chromosome 9 and a piece of chromosome 22 break off and switch places This creates a new, abnormal chromosome 22 that contains a small part of chromosome This new chromosome is referred to as the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) and is the hallmark of CML If you do not have the Ph chromosome or the BCR::ABL1 gene, you do not have

treatment decisions It describes the size and location of the tumor and if cancer has spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body This chapter explains nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) stages The spread (metastasis) to distant sites (M): Has the cancer spread to distant organs such as the lungs or liver Biomarker testing: Does the cancer have any genes or mutations that might suggest treatment Staging is based on a combination of information to reach a final numbered stage Often, not all information is available at the initial evaluation More information can be gathered as treatment begins Doctors may explain your cancer stage in different ways than described next How NPC is staged A cancer stage is a way to describe the extent of the cancer at the time you are first diagnosed The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) created a staging system to determine how much cancer is in your body, where it is located, and what subtype you have This is called staging Cancer staging is not the same for all cancer types and locations Based on testing, your cancer will be assigned a stage Staging helps to predict prognosis and is needed to make treatment decisions A prognosis is the course your cancer will likely take AJCC is just one type of staging system Information gathered during staging: The extent (size) of the tumor (T): How large is the cancer Has it grown into nearby areas The spread to nearby lymph nodes (N): Has the cancer spread to nearby lymph nodes If so, how many Where Staging includes: h Anatomic \u2013 based on extent of cancer as defined by tumor size (T), lymph node status (N), and distant metastasis (M) Prognostic \u2013 includes anatomic TNM and often Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) levels in the blood The prognostic stage also includes the assumption that you are treated with the standard-of-care approaches Prognostic stages are divided into clinical and pathologic Cancer staging is often done twice, before and after surgery Staging after surgery provides more specific and accurate details about the size of the cancer and lymph node status Clinical stage Clinical stage (c) is the rating given before any treatment It is based on a physical exam, biopsy, and imaging tests An example might look like cN2 or cMIn nasopharyngeal cancer, the clinical stage is based on imaging and biopsy results These tests are done before any treatment as part of an initial diagnosis Pathologic stage Pathologic stage (p) or surgical stage is determined by examining tissue removed during surgery An example might be pNIf you are given cancer drug therapy before surgery, then the stage might add a \"y\" and look like ypT How cancer can spread Nasopharyngeal cancer can spread to nearby lymph nodes, and areas such as the nasal cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, base of the skull, jaw, and roof of the mouth Anatomy of the Pharynx TNM scores The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system is used to stage throat cancer In this system, the letters T, N, and M describe different areas of cancer growth Based on imaging and pathology results, a score or number is assigned to each letter The higher the number, the larger the tumor or the more the cancer

cancer is a type of cancer that affects the lips, the front two-thirds of the tongue, the gums, the lining inside the cheeks and lips, the floor (bottom) of the mouth under the tongue, the hard palate (bony top of the mouth), the bony ridges that hold the sockets of the teeth, and the small area of the gum behind the wisdom teeth The mouth, or oral cavity, is the first part of the digestive and respiratory (breathing) systems The lips, cheeks, palate, teeth, and tongue make up the mouth The mouth helps us breathe, talk, chew, taste, swallow, eat, and drink The cheeks and lips hold food in the mouth and help to form and sound words Parts of the mouth The 2 main functions of the mouth are eating and speaking The mouth is also known as the oral cavity or the buccal cavity Some important structures of the mouth: Hard palate is the hard, bony part of the roof of the mouth The mouth Tongue is a muscular organ in your mouth that aids in chewing, speaking, and breathing Lips surround the opening of the mouth Buccal (oral) mucosa is the lining inside the cheeks and inside where the lips touch the teeth Alveolar ridge is the bony, raised area of the upper (maxilla) and lower (mandible) jaw that holds the sockets of the teeth Gums (gingiva) surround the base of the teeth and help keep them in place Retromolar trigone is the small area behind the wisdom teeth Oral mucosa The oral mucosa is the mucous membrane lining the inside of the mouth and lips It is made up of 2 layers Epithelium \u2013 The surface layer containing stratified squamous cells, which are thin, flat cells Lamina propria \u2013 The bottom layer of connective tissue A tumor can grow through the layers of the oral mucosa A measure of how deep the tumor has grown is called depth of invasion (DOI) Depending on the region of the mouth, the epithelium may be nonkeratinized or keratinized Nonkeratinized squamous epithelium covers the soft palate, inner lips, inner cheeks, the floor of the mouth, and area underneath the tongue Keratinized squamous epithelium is present on rough surfaces caused by chewing such as the gums (gingiva) and hard palate as well as the top of the tongue Head and neck cancer Head and neck cancer is a group of cancers that arise in the head or neck area of the body Cancer is named and treated based on the tumor location or where the cancer started Cancer can occur in the

cancer that you could join Cancer-causing agents You are more likely to get lung cancer, especially if you smoke, after exposure to: Radon Asbestos Arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, and nickel Coal smoke, soot, silica, and diesel fumes Air pollution by fine particulates, ozone, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide\nLung cancer screening basics The lungs Lung cancer Early detection Key points Lung cancer starts in the cells of the lungs For those at risk of developing lung cancer, regular screening can help find lung cancer at its earliest, most treatable stages The lungs The lungs are a pair of organs located in the chest The lungs move important gases in and out of the blood You breathe in oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide (a gas made by cells) from the body The lungs have sections called lobes The left lung has 2 lobes and the right lung has 3 lobes A thin layer of tissue surrounds the lungs called the pleural membrane This membrane protects the lungs Two large breathing tubes, called bronchi, connect the windpipe (trachea) to the lungs There is one tube, called a bronchus, for each lung Inside the lungs are small tubes (bronchioles) and small air sacs (alveoli) The respiratory system The air you breathe moves through a series of airways It travels down your throat and through your windpipe (trachea) The windpipe splits into 2 airways called bronchi Inside the lung, each bronchus branches off into the parts of the lung called lobes The right lung has 3 lobes and the left lung has 2 lobes The bronchi divide into smaller airways called the bronchioles At the end of the bronchioli are sacs called alveoli From here, oxygen is transferred into your blood Lung cancer Almost all lung cancers are a subtype called carcinomas Lung carcinomas start in the cells that line the airways of the lungs The airways of the lungs include the bronchus, bronchioles, and alveoli There are different types of lung carcinoma The main types are non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer Other types of cancer can spread to the lungs, such as breast cancer Breast cancer that has spread to the lungs is still called breast cancer Non-small cell lung cancer Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a group of cancers that are the most common type of lung cancer NSCLC can be broken down into subtypes by looking at the cancer cells under a microscope This is called histology Adenocarcinoma starts in the mucusmaking cells that line the alveoli (small air sacs) This is the most common subtype About 4 out of 10 lung cancers are adenocarcinomas This is the most common type of lung cancer seen in those who don\u2019t smoke or who don\u2019t have a history of smoking More information on NSCLC and SCLC is available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app Squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinoma starts in the flat cells that line the inside of the airways (bronchi) in the lungs About 3 out of 10 lung cancers are squamous cell carcinomas Large cell (undifferentiated) carcinoma starts in large cells that can grow anywhere in the lungs This accounts for 5 out of 10 NSCLCs Small cell lung cancer Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a fast-dividing cancer of the neuroendocrine cells Under a microscope, the cancer cells look small and oval- or oat-shaped It is the second most common type of lung cancer About 1 out of every 10 lung cancers are SCLC Early detection The goal of lung cancer screening is to find lung cancer at an early stage, even before there are any symptoms This is when treatment will be most successful Early detection of lung cancer helps prevent death Together, you and your health care provider should discuss if screening is right for you Key points The lungs are a pair of organs that

may be eligible for a clinical trial Imaging Imaging tests take pictures (images) of the insides of your body The images show areas in the body that might have cancer The images can reveal a lymphoma\u2019s location, size, and other features MRI Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most useful imaging technique for identifying primary CNS lymphoma An MRI scan is good at showing the spine and soft tissues, including the brain, as well as other details that are helpful for planning surgery MRI uses radio waves and powerful magnets to take pictures of the inside of the body During an MRI, you\u2019ll lie on a table that slides into the scanning machine. (An open MRI scanner may be an option at some health care centers.) It\u2019s important to lie still during the test to get the best pictures The machine makes loud noises but you can wear earplugs An MRI of the brain or spinal cord usually requires a contrast agent (also called contrast dye or just contrast) Contrast highlights areas in organs, blood vessels, or other tissues to make them easier to see The contrast is injected into the bloodstream through an intravenous (IV) line before or during the imaging test and later flushed out in urine The contrast agent used for primary CNS lymphoma is called gadolinium You\u2019ll have multiple MRI tests throughout diagnosis and treatment An MRI should be done early on if your symptoms suggest a brain tumor It\u2019s also used right after treatment to see how well the treatment worked You\u2019ll have more MRIs during follow-up to watch for any recurrence or new growth CT If MRI is unavailable or not recommended for you, you might have a computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan instead A CT scan uses x-rays to take many images of your body from different angles A computer then combines the pictures to make a 3D image After imaging After the MRI or CT scan, your images will be studied by a radiologist, an expert in analyzing images of the nervous system The radiologist will convey the imaging results to your care team This information helps your team plan what the next steps of your

primary CNS lymphoma It\u2019s important to lie still during the test to get the best images Straps or other devices may help you avoid moving Biopsy If imaging scans show something that may be a primary CNS lymphoma, your care providers will want to take a sample and test it A procedure that removes a small piece of tissue for testing is called a biopsy Getting a biopsy is the only way to be certain that you have cancer A biopsy also gives your care team clues on how to treat it The standard method for diagnosing primary CNS lymphoma is a stereotactic biopsy It\u2019s the recommended procedure when a brain tumor is in a hard-to-reach or vital area It aims to remove only enough of the tumor to make a diagnosis A stereotactic biopsy is done by a neurosurgeon in an operating room First, you\u2019ll be fitted with a frame or several tiny markers around your head to aid the surgery Next, you\u2019ll be given anesthesia to go to sleep A small area of your hair will be shaved down to the scalp The neurosurgeon will then make a little opening in your skull and insert a thin, hollow needle into the brain to remove a sliver of the tumor A computerized navigation system, connected to MRI or CT imaging, will allow the surgeon to target and remove the sample with a high degree of precision After removal, the opening in your scalp will be closed with sutures and you\u2019ll be able to go home What an MRI shows An MRI scan highlights primary CNS lymphoma in the brain People with primary CNS lymphoma may have one or multiple tumors appear on their scan Image: Stephanie E

How is basal cell skin cancer treated What can you do to get the best care Basal cell skin cancer, also known as basal cell carcinoma (BCC), is the most common type of skin cancer About 3 million cases of basal cell skin cancer are diagnosed every year in the United States The good news is it can be cured in most cases Treatment usually involves surgery to remove the cancer Keep reading to find out more What is basal cell skin cancer Basal cell skin cancer is the most common of all skin cancer types If caught early, it is easily treatable and curable This is because it rarely metastasizes (spreads) Skin cancers often occur in the top layer of the skin (epidermis) and less commonly in the middle layer of the skin (dermis) The epidermis is made up of basal cells and other cells Basal cell skin cancer occurs when some basal cells become abnormal and grow out of control This cancer usually develops in areas exposed to the sun, including the face, head, neck, arms, legs, and trunk But it can occur anywhere on the body Skin lesions Basal cell skin cancer is often found on the face, head, and neck Here is a basal cell lesion pictured on a person's cheek Skin basics Did you know that your skin is your body\u2019s largest organ and if you measured it it would stretch to about 20 square feet Working as a barrier, your skin protects you from bacteria and chemicals and helps control your body temperature It has 3 layers: Epidermis \u2013 The top layer of skin provides a waterproof barrier and creates skin color (melanin) Dermis \u2013 The middle layer involves connective tissue, blood vessels, oil and sweat glands, nerves, and hair follicles Hypodermis \u2013 The deepest tissue layer is made up of fat and connective tissue Most skin cancers form in the cells of the epidermis It has 3 main types of cells: Squamous cells \u2013 These cells are flat cells found in the upper part of the epidermis Basal cells \u2013 Found in the lower part of the epidermis, basal cells constantly divide to form new cells that replace the squamous cells on the skin\u2019s surface Melanocytes \u2013 Melanocytes are cells located in the lower part of the epidermis that produce melanin Melanin is responsible for our hair, skin, and eye color It also protects our skin from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays This book is only about basal cell skin cancer For more information on squamous cell skin cancer or melanoma, read the NCCN Guidelines for Patients, available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app Signs and symptoms Basal cell skin cancer can happen to anyone but it\u2019s most common in people with lighter skin, lighter hair, or lighter eyes In lighter skin, its lesions can look like any of the following: h Flat, pale or yellow areas, like a scar h Red patches that might be itchy Small, pink or red, shiny bumps that may have blue, brown, or black areas Open sores that don\u2019t heal and might bleed, or go away and come back In darker (brown and black) skin, basal cell skin cancer can appear as a brown or glossy black bump with a rolled border It can be mistaken for a normal mole Be sure to look out for any new, changing, bleeding, or unusual skin growths Skin cancer is easier to cure when it is caught early To find out how basal cell skin cancer is diagnosed, read Chapter 2: Testing for basal cell skin cancer Causes and risk factors Basal cell skin cancer is caused by exposure to UV radiation from the sun or other sources like tanning beds UV radiation can harm the DNA inside basal skin cells DNA controls how cells grow and function If the DNA inside cells becomes damaged, the cells can become abnormal and grow out of control You\u2019re more likely to have basal cell skin cancer if you have certain risk factors A risk factor increases the chance of developing cancer Risk factors for basal cell skin cancer include: UV light exposure \u2013 UV light (radiation)

cytometry It can detect common patterns of proteins on the outside of cells Most cells have an identifiable pattern of proteins, like a silhouette or a shape, called the immunophenotype A CLL diagnosis requires at least 5,000 or more of the same white blood cells called monoclonal B lymphocytes to be found per microliter in your blood Diagnosis by biopsy A biopsy is a procedure that removes samples from the body for testing If the blood results aren\u2019t clear, you\u2019ll have a biopsy of your lymph nodes or bone marrow to confirm CLL Tests of lymph nodes will also confirm

trials are a key way to assess new treatment approaches After being developed and tested in a laboratory, potential new ways of fighting cancer need to be studied in people If found to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a drug, device, or treatment approach may be approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Talk to your treatment team about whether a clinical trial makes sense for you Everyone with cancer should carefully consider all the treatment options available for their type of cancer, including standard treatments and clinical trials Who can enroll Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called eligibility criteria The rules may be about age, cancer type and stage, treatment history, or general health These requirements ensure that participants are alike in certain ways in order to compare how their disease responds to a specific treatment Informed consent Clinical trials are managed by a group of experts called a research team The research team will review the study with you in detail, including its purpose and the risks and benefits of joining", "extracted_entities": ["Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma", "NCCN Guidelines for

images are combined to make one detailed picture A CT scan of your head, neck, and chest may be one of the tests to look for cancer In most cases, contrast will be used MRI scan A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan uses radio waves and powerful magnets to take pictures of the inside of the body It does not use -rays Because of the very strong magnets used in the MRI machine, tell the technologist if you have any metal in your body During the test, you will likely be asked to hold your breath for 10 to 20 seconds as the technician collects the images Contrast is often used A closed MRI has a capsule-like design where the magnet surrounds you An open MRI has a magnetic top and bottom, which allows for an opening on each end Closed MRIs are more common than open MRIs, so if you have claustrophobia (a dread or fear of enclosed spaces), be sure to talk to your care team about it PET scan A positron emission tomography (PET) scan uses a radioactive drug called a tracer A tracer is a substance injected into a vein to see where cancer cells are in the body and if they are using sugar produced by your body to grow Cancer cells show up as bright spots on PET scans However, not all tumors will appear on a PET scan Also, not all bright spots are cancer It is normal for the brain, heart, kidneys, and bladder to be bright on PET Inflammation or infection can also show up as a bright spot When a PET scan is combined with CT, it is called a PET/CT scan FDG-PET/CT An FDG-PET/CT uses a radiotracer called fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) It is made of fluoride and a simple form of sugar called glucose You cannot eat or drink for at least 4 hours before the scan This scan is most helpful when other imaging results are unclear It may help find cancer in lymph nodes and distant sites If it clearly shows cancer in the bone, a bone scan and sodium fluoride PET/ CT may not be needed FDG-PET/CT can be done at the same time as a CT used for diagnosis Ultrasound Ultrasound (US) uses high-energy sound waves to form pictures of the inside of the body This is similar to the sonogram used for pregnancy A wand-like probe (transducer) will be held and moved on your neck using gel Ultrasound is painless and does not use x-rays, so it can be repeated as needed Ultrasound is good at showing small areas of cancer that may be in lymph nodes Sometimes, an ultrasound or CT is used to guide a fine-needle biopsy (FNB) Panoramic dental x-ray A panoramic dental -ray or panoramic x-ray (Panorex) uses a very small dose of radiation to capture the entire mouth in one image, including the teeth, upper and lower jaw, and surrounding structures and tissues It is commonly performed by dentists and oral surgeons in everyday practice and may be used to plan treatment for dentures, braces, extractions, and implants Biopsy A biopsy removes a sample of tissue or fluid Samples removed during a biopsy or surgery will be sent to a pathologist, an expert in examining cells using a microscope (called cytology) to confirm the presence of cancer The pathologist will determine the cancer subtype called tumor histology A fine-needle aspiration (FNA), fine-needle biopsy (FNB), and core needle biopsy (CNB) use needles of different sizes to remove a sample of tumor or lymph node An ultrasound or CT scan might be used to guide a lymph node biopsy Biopsy of metastasis Metastasis is the spread of cancer to an area of the body such as lymph nodes or lung A biopsy of the metastasis may be needed to confirm the presence of cancer If there is more than one metastasis, each site may be biopsied

determine if it is a low-, high- or very high-risk CSCC This is called a risk assessment The risk level or category for skin cancer is usually based on the highest risk factor found If the tumor has grown into a nerve or group of nerves, usually seen under the microscope, it is a high-risk or very highrisk cancer The tumor grade is a rating of how fast your doctors expect the cancer to grow and spread The deeper the tumor has invaded into the skin, the higher the risk of the cancer returning after treatment Recommended types of surgery for local, low-risk CSCC include curettage and electrodesiccation (C&E), standard surgical excision, or Mohs surgery or another form of PDEMA For low-risk CSCC in non-surgical candidates, treatment with radiation therapy is an option Recommended types of surgery for local, high-risk or very high-risk CSCC include Mohs surgery/PDEMA and standard surgical excision For high-risk or very high-risk CSCC in non-surgical candidates, treatment with radiation therapy and/or systemic therapy is an option. 4 Regional CSCC (in lymph nodes) Testing Treatment Metastatic squamous cell skin cancer Key points Squamous cell carcinoma that has spread to nearby lymph nodes is known as \u201cregional\u201d The goal of testing for regional cancer will be to see how and where the cancer has spread, so your care team can determine the best treatment plan Imaging If biopsy results confirm that the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes, a computed tomography (CT) scan of lymph nodes near the CSCC is recommended The goal is to learn about the number, location, and size of the lymph nodes with cancer More advanced imaging tests like a PET/CT, that uses special injectable agents to detect cancer, may be needed to see if cancer has spread farther than the lymph nodes, or to help plan treatment Testing Biopsy If lymph nodes near the CSCC feel swollen or look abnormal on initial imaging tests, the next step is a biopsy The types of biopsies used for squamous cell skin cancer are fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and core needle biopsy FNA is also known simply as needle biopsy Surgical evaluation The results of testing will be considered in order to determine if you are a candidate for surgery to remove the cancerous lesion and nearby lymph nodes Know your options It is always important to discuss with your doctor and care team about what your treatment options are, and any preferences or concerns you might have Treatment Surgery is recommended to treat squamous cell skin cancer that has spread to nearby lymph nodes Surgery for regional CSCC involves excision (removal) of the cancerous lesion and nearby lymph nodes Although surgery is preferred, it may not be an option for one or more reasons In this case, see If surgery is not an option below for information If surgery is very risky or might not completely remove your cancer, your doctor may suggest immunotherapy with cemiplimab-rwlc (Libtayo) first It may shrink the tumor and make surgery less risky Head and neck tumors Lymph nodes may be removed from one or both sides of the neck during surgery for head and neck tumors The extent of surgery depends on the number, location, and size of the lymph nodes with cancer After surgery, radiation therapy is often given to decrease the chance of the tumor returning Systemic therapy is sometimes used in addition to radiation therapy after surgery This may be the case if: Lymph nodes with cancer were not removed during surgery, or Cancer was found to have grown through the protective outer layer of any lymph nodes removed during surgery (called extracapsular or extranodal extension) In either of these situations, a discussion between different cancer doctors is recommended If systemic therapy is planned, platinum-based chemotherapy is preferred for use with radiation if you can have it Tumors on other areas of the body Surgery is the best way to treat tumors that have spread to other areas of the body if possible Surgery removes the tumor and nearby lymph nodes Radiation therapy may be given after surgery to kill leftover cancer cells This is important if there was more than one lymph node with

accelerator (linac) to aim radiation at the whole breast (WBRT) and lymph nodes (RNI) Chemotherapy Systemic therapy is drug therapy that works throughout the body It is used before surgery to shrink the tumor or reduce the amount of cancer (called cancer burden) Preoperative is systemic (drug) treatment given before surgery It is also called neoadjuvant therapy Postoperative is systemic (drug) treatment given after surgery It is also called adjuvant therapy Chemotherapy kills fast-dividing cells throughout the body, including cancer cells and some normal cells More than one chemotherapy may be used to treat inflammatory breast cancer When only one drug is used, it\u2019s called a single agent A combination or multi-agent regimen is the use of two or more chemotherapy drugs Warnings about supplements and drug interactions You might be asked to stop taking or avoid certain herbal supplements when on a systemic therapy Some supplements can affect the ability of a drug to do its job This is called a drug interaction It is critical to speak with your care team about any supplements you may be taking Some examples include: Turmeric Gingko biloba Green tea extract St John\u2019s Wort Antioxidants Certain medicines can also affect the ability of a drug to do its job Antacids, heart or blood pressure medicine, and antidepressants are just some of the medicines that might interact with a systemic therapy Therefore, it is very important to tell your care team about any medicines, vitamins, over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, herbals, or supplements you are taking Bring a list with you to every visit Some chemotherapy drugs are liquids that are infused into a vein or injected under the skin with a needle Other chemotherapy drugs may be given as a pill that is swallowed Some examples of chemotherapy drugs include: h Doxorubicin (Adriamcyin), doxorubicin liposomal injection (Doxil), and epirubicin (Ellence) are anthracyclines Docetaxel, paclitaxel, and albumin-bound paclitaxel are taxanes Capecitabine (Xeloda), fluorouracil, gemcitabine (Gemzar, Infugem), and methotrexate are antimetabolites Most chemotherapy is given in cycles of treatment days followed by days of rest This

chapter presents an overview of possible tests you might receive and what to expect Overview Accurate testing is needed to diagnose and treat AML A diagnosis of AML is based on the presence of myeloid blasts in the bone marrow or blood The number of blasts required to be diagnosed with AML can vary In general, the number of blasts must be 20 percent or more of all cells found in the bone marrow This means that at least 1 out of every 5 bone marrow cells are blasts However, a diagnosis of AML is possible with any number of blasts, particularly if certain gene mutations or abnormal chromosomes are also present Unlike other cancers of organs, like lung cancer or breast cancer, AML does not have stages Many cancers spread from the location where they originate, and the extent or severity of cancer is determined by how far it has spread AML arises from the bone marrow, which is present in nearly all of our bones Because AML cells arise from multiple bones and flow in the blood all over

Polyps with cancer Early rectal cancer Locally advanced cancer Recurrence Key points Rectal cancer often forms in polyps on the lining of the rectum, but can also form as lesions This chapter explains treatment for rectal cancer that hasn't spread to areas far from the rectum Polyps with cancer A polyp is an overgrowth of cells on the inner lining of the rectal wall Adenomas are the most common type While it may take many years, they can become invasive cancer Cancer that forms in an adenoma is called an adenocarcinoma There are 2 main shapes of polyps Pedunculated polyps are shaped like mushrooms and stick out from the colon wall They have a stalk and round top Sessile polyps are flatter and do not have a stalk A polyp in which cancer has just started to grow is called a malignant (cancerous) polyp Most polyps can be removed during a colonoscopy, using a minor surgical procedure called a polypectomy Often, no further Polyps Polyps are growths on the lining of the bowel wall Pedunculated polyps look like mushrooms and stick out from the colon wall Sessile polyps are flatter and don't have a stalk. treatment is needed In other cases, resection (surgical removal) of a larger piece of the rectum is needed This depends on the following factors: The size and shape of the polyp The polypectomy results The results of testing the removed tissue Before deciding whether resection is needed after a polypectomy, your provider will review the results of testing with you and discuss your options Sessile polyps are more likely to return after treatment Imaging with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended for these polyps to help guide decisions about surgery Early rectal cancer If cancer that formed in a polyp isn't found early enough to be removed by polypectomy, surgery is needed Surgery is also needed for rectal cancer that forms as a lesion on the rectal wall The true extent of the cancer can't be known until after surgery But it can be estimated based on certain test results This best guess is called the clinical or pre-surgery stage It is used to determine your treatment options Endoscopic submucosal dissection If testing finds that the tumor hasn\u2019t grown beyond the second (muscle) layer of the rectal wall, it is a T1 tumor Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a recommended option for all T1 tumors This minimally invasive procedure removes small rectal cancers in one piece, often curing them Another name for this procedure is endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) First, an endoscope is used to locate the tumor in the rectal wall A tool is guided through the scope to inject fluid between the tumor and the layer of muscle beneath it This helps lift and separate the tumor, making it easier to cut off Most people don\u2019t need more treatment Surveillance after ESD Checking for recurrence is recommended for at least 5 years after ESD During this time you will have flexible sigmoidoscopy about every 6 months The first one may be as early as 3 months after ESD Imaging with endorectal ultrasound or pelvic MRI (with contrast) is recommended every 3 to 6 months for the first 2 years, then every 6 months through the fifth year Transanal local excision For T1 tumors located at the end of the rectum, removing them through the anus may be an option This is called transanal local excision The surgeon cuts through all layers of the rectal wall to remove the cancer and some surrounding normal rectal tissue Lymph nodes are not removed Advanced techniques for removing tumors higher in the rectum include transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) and transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS)", "extracted_entities": ["rectal cancer", "CT", "liver", "lungs", "adenomas",

the throat called the oropharynx The oropharynx includes the back of the roof of the mouth (soft palate), the tonsils, the side and back walls of throat, and the base of the tongue The throat The throat is a hollow, muscular tube inside the neck that starts behind the nose and ends at the top of the trachea (windpipe) and esophagus (the tube that goes to the stomach) The throat acts as a passageway for air to enter the lungs and food and liquid to enter the esophagus It contains many structures, including the tonsils, pharynx, and larynx Some important structures of the throat and mouth: Oral cavity is another name for mouth Hard palate is the hard, front part of the roof of the mouth behind the teeth Soft palate is the soft, back part of the roof of the mouth Tongue includes several muscles that extend from your hyoid bone (located in the middle of your neck) to the floor of your mouth Pharynx is the throat Larynx is a specific part of the throat also known as the voice box Esophagus is a hollow muscular tube that carries food and liquid to the stomach Trachea or windpipe leads to the lungs The pharynx The pharynx is part of the throat and starts behind the nose (nasal cavity) and opens into the larynx and esophagus The pharynx (said fair-inks) has 3 parts: Nasopharynx Oropharynx Hypopharynx Cancer can be found in any part of the pharynx This book will focus

aspirate and biopsy, and imaging studies will be used to guide your treatment plan It is important to have regular talks with your care team about your goals for treatment and your treatment plan Care team Treating acute myeloid leukemia (AML) takes a team approach Treatment decisions should involve a multidisciplinary team (MDT) An MDT is a team of health care and psychosocial care professionals from different professional backgrounds who have knowledge (expertise) and experience in your type of cancer This team is united in the planning and implementing of your treatment Ask who will coordinate your care Some members of your care team will be with you throughout cancer treatment, while others will only be there for parts of it Get to know your care team and help them get to know you Your team might include the following doctors: A hematologist or hematologic oncologist is a medical expert in blood diseases and blood cancers and treats these conditions A medical oncologist treats cancer using systemic (drug) therapy A pathologist or hematopathologist analyzes the cells and tissues removed during a biopsy and provides cancer diagnosis, staging, and information about biomarker testing Systemic therapy Systemic therapy works throughout the body Types include chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy Systemic therapy might be used alone or with other therapies Goals of systemic therapy should be discussed before starting treatment Your preferences about treatment are important If you have any religious or personal beliefs about certain kinds of treatment, now would be the time to share them with your care team You will likely get either a catheter or a port to deliver systemic therapy, fluids, and blood products into your body A catheter is a thin, long tube that is often placed in the upper arm This goes into a large vein and stays there until treatment is complete A port is a small, round disc that is usually placed in the chest The type and location of catheter or port will be tailored to your needs and treatment plans Treatment options Treatment options are often described in the following ways: Preferred therapies have the most evidence they work better and may be safer than other therapies Other recommended therapies may not work quite as well as preferred therapies, but they can still help treat cancer Therapies used in certain cases work best for people with specific cancer features or health circumstances Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is the standard of care for treating AML Chemotherapy kills fast-dividing cells throughout the body, including cancer cells and normal cells Standard of care is the best-known way to treat a particular disease based on past clinical trials There may be more than one treatment regimen that is considered standard of care Ask your care team what treatment options are available and if a clinical trial might be right for you Chemotherapy is most often a liquid that is slowly injected into a vein with a needle The final dose differs between people because it is based on body weight In most cases, chemotherapy is given in cycles of treatment days followed by days of rest This allows the body to recover before the next cycle Cycles vary in length depending on which chemotherapy is used You might spend time in the hospital during treatment Types of chemotherapy There are many types of chemotherapy used to treat AML Often chemotherapies are combined This is called multi-agent chemotherapy or a multi-agent regimen Each chemotherapy works in a different way and causes different side effects Talk to your care team about the types of chemotherapy you will be given, when you will get them, and what side effects to expect Antimetabolites Antimetabolites prevent the building blocks of DNA from being used Examples include: Cladribine (Mavenclad) Clofarabine (Clolar) Cytarabine (Ara-C) Fludarabine Methotrexate Anthracyclines Anthracyclines damage and disrupt the making of DNA causing cell death of both cancerous and non-cancerous cells Some anthracyclines can cause heart issues They may not be an option for you There is a limit to how much you can receive in your lifetime Anthracycline examples include daunorubicin, idarubicin (Idamycin PFS), and mitoxantrone (Novantrone) Dual-drug liposome of cytarabine and daunorubicin (CPX-351 or Vyxeos) includes an

show up as a bright spot When a PET scan is combined with CT, it is called a PET/CT scan An FDG-PET/CT uses a radiotracer called fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) It is made of fluoride and a simple form of sugar called glucose You cannot eat or drink for at least 4 hours before the scan This scan is most helpful when other imaging results are unclear Biopsy A biopsy is the removal of a sample of tissue from your body for testing A diagnosis of bone cancer is confirmed using a core needle or surgical biopsy The placement of the biopsy is critical Therefore, it is recommended that the biopsy be performed by an experienced surgeon at the center where you will receive treatment Core needle biopsy removes tissue samples with a hollow needle that can grab a piece of tissue This is frequently performed under light sedation by an interventional radiologist It can also be performed by your surgeon in the office Surgical (open) biopsy removes a sample of the tumor through a small incision A surgical biopsy should be performed by your treating surgeon This requires a trip to the operating room Bone marrow tests Bone marrow tests might be done in certain cases There are 2 types of bone marrow tests that are often done at the same time: Bone marrow aspirate Bone marrow biopsy It is recommended that a biopsy be performed by an experienced surgeon at the cancer center where you will receive treatment Your bone marrow is like a sponge holding liquid and cells An aspirate takes some of the liquid and cells out of the sponge, and a biopsy takes a piece of the sponge The samples are usually taken from the back of the hip bone (pelvis) You will likely lie on your belly or side Your doctors will first clean and give sedation and/or numb your skin and outer surface of your bone For an aspirate, a hollow needle will be pushed through your skin and into the bone Liquid bone marrow will then be drawn into a syringe For the biopsy, a wider needle will be used to remove a core sample You may feel bone pain at your hip for a few days Your skin may bruise Genetic cancer risk testing Genetic testing is done using blood or saliva from spitting into a cup or a cheek swab The goal is to look for gene mutations inherited from your birth parents called germline mutations Some mutations can put you at risk for more than one type of cancer You can pass these genes on to your children Also, blood relatives might carry these mutations Tell your care team if there is a family history of cancer Biomarker testing A sample from your biopsy will undergo lab tests to look for specific DNA mutations/ alterations, protein levels, or other molecular features Biomarker testing is performed on a case-by-case basis and may increase the time it takes for biopsy results Biomarker testing is sometimes called molecular testing or tumor profiling, tumor sequencing, gene expression profiling, or genomic testing Your care team will recommend the best types of biomarker testing that are important for you Biomarker testing includes tests of genes or their products (proteins) It identifies the presence or absence of mutations and certain proteins that might suggest treatment Proteins are written like this: IDHGenes are written with italics like this: IDHWhen a gene or protein is found, it is shown with a plus sign like this: When a gene or protein has not been found, it is written with a negative sign like this: IDH1- Ewing sarcoma A cell must make a copy of its chromosomes before dividing into two cells Sometimes, there are mistakes in the copies One type of mistake is when parts (DNA) of two chromosomes break off and switch with each other This is called a translocation It can result in a fusion of two genes A translocation between chromosomes 11 and 22 is written as t(11;22) and is common in Ewing sarcoma Ewing sarcoma is characterized by the fusion of the EWS gene (EWSR1) on chromosome 22 with various members of the ETS gene family (FLI1, ERG, ETV1, ETV4, and

for CLL There is currently no cure for CLL, but you can get effective treatment so your blood cells will be mostly healthy ones and a full life is possible This is a condition called minimal residual disease We\u2019ll describe this in a later chapter While the goal of treatment is not to cure CLL, the goal is to prevent the disease from causing problems and from becoming life-threatening What is SLL Small lymphocytic lymphoma, or SLL, is the same cancer as CLL The only difference between the two is where the abnormal cells are found CLL is mostly found in the blood and bone marrow SLL is mostly found in lymph nodes and the spleen If a person has fewer than 5,000 cancerous cells in their blood, it is considered SLL Anything more than that is considered CLL The lymph nodes and spleen play a key role in fighting infections CLL can also be found in the lymph nodes Lymph nodes and the spleen may be swollen because of a buildup of CLL or SLL cells Treatment of CLL and SLL is the same because the cancer cells are the same For this book, treat any recommendation for CLL as one for SLL For this reason, the disease is often referred to as CLL/SLL What can you do to get the best care Advocate for yourself You have an important role to play in your care In fact, you\u2019re more likely to get the care you want by asking questions and making shared decisions with your care team The

called a hematopathologist is an expert at diagnosing cancers of blood and immune cells They look at blood, bone Immunophenotype Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) often has a common pattern of surface proteins on its cells An example of these proteins is CD20 (shown) It helps identify the correct type of cancer For instance, CLL cells have proteins called CD200 and LEF1, but another type of

needed Platelets (PLTs) are cells that make the clot, thus preventing or stopping the bleeding. h An absolute neutrophil count (ANC) measures cells that fight bacteria and protect us from infections Blasts or leukemia cells can sometimes be detected in the blood and usually are reported as a percentage of cells Comprehensive metabolic panel A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) measures substances in your blood It provides important information about how well your kidneys and liver are working, among other things Creatinine Creatinine is a waste produced in the muscles Every person generates a fixed amount of creatinine every day based on how much muscle they have It is filtered out of the blood by the kidneys The level of creatinine in the blood tells how well the kidneys are working Higher levels of creatinine mean the kidneys aren\u2019t working as well as they were when someone had lower levels of creatinine Blood urea nitrogen Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is a waste product filtered out of the blood by the kidneys A high level of BUN can be a sign your kidneys aren\u2019t working well Electrolytes Electrolytes help move nutrients into cells and help move waste out of cells Electrolytes are ions or particles with electrical charges that help the nerves, muscles, heart, and brain work as they should Your body needs electrolytes to function properly Lactate dehydrogenase Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or lactic acid dehydrogenase is an enzyme found in most cells Dying cells release LDH into blood Fastgrowing cells, such as tumor cells, also release LDH Liver function tests Liver function tests (LFTs) look at the health of the liver by measuring chemicals that are made or processed by the liver Levels that are too high or low signal that the liver is not working well or the bile ducts might be blocked B12 and folic acid Vitamin B12 and folic acid (folate) help the body make new proteins They are needed for normal red blood cell (RBC) and white blood cell (WBC) formation B12 and folic acid levels will be monitored You may be given vitamin supplements, if needed Iron Iron is important in maintaining body functions such as producing hemoglobin, the molecule in your blood that carries oxygen You might be monitored for low levels of iron called iron deficiency You may be given an intravenous (IV) iron supplement, if needed It is possible to have too much iron in the body called overload Therefore, only take what is prescribed by your doctor Blood clotting tests Your body stops bleeding by turning blood into a gel-like form The gel-like blood forms into a solid mass called a blood clot Clotting is a process or series of events Proteins, called coagulation factors, are needed for clotting They are made by the liver These tests are known together as a coagulation panel or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) panel It is standard to screen for clotting problems An impaired clotting process is common in leukemia

five Grade Groups, numbered 1 to The higher the Grade Group, the more aggressive the cancer So cancer with a Gleason score of 6 is assigned as Grade Group 1 to show that it is the lowest score Likewise, cancer with a Gleason score of 9 or 10 becomes Grade Group 5, the highest score Importantly, the Grade Group system also takes into account that Grade Group 2 and Grade Group 3 both have a Gleason score of The difference is the cancer in Grade Group 3 is more serious Why Because the first number of the Gleason score in Grade Group 3 is higher than the first number in Grade Group 2

prostate cancer What causes prostate cancer What is advanced-stage prostate cancer Can prostate cancer be cured What\u2019s the best treatment Key points The prostate is a gland located deep inside the pelvis Everyone with a prostate has a chance of getting prostate cancer This chapter offers an overview of this common cancer What is prostate cancer Prostate cancer is a disease where cells in the prostate gland grow out of control The prostate is a gland located just below the bladder in the pelvis, deep inside the area of your body between your hip bones The prostate is an important part of the male reproductive system Besides the prostate, the male reproductive system includes the penis, seminal vesicles, and testicles Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer Cancer is what happens when something goes wrong with the natural cell process, which causes some cells to grow out of control Cancer cells don\u2019t behave like normal cells Cancer cells develop genetic changes (mutations) that allow them to multiply and make many more cancer cells The cancer cells crowd out and overwhelm normal cells This can end up harming the body Cancer cells can survive much longer than normal cells do They can replace many normal cells and cause organs to stop working well Cancer cells can also spread outside the prostate to other areas of the body The prostate gland is an important part of the male reproductive system It\u2019s located in the pelvis just below the bladder and is typically about the size of a pingpong ball What are the symptoms of prostate cancer A symptom is a feeling or problem that can indicate a disease or condition Prostate cancer often grows slowly and shows no symptoms for a long time You don\u2019t have to have symptoms to have prostate cancer Symptoms, if they occur, may include: Blood in the urine or semen Burning or pain while urinating Unexplained weight loss Bone, hip, or back pain It\u2019s important to know that prostate cancer has many of the same symptoms as a condition called enlarged prostate (also called benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH) An enlarged prostate can push against the bladder and compress the urethra, which slows the flow of urine and can cause a feeling that you haven\u2019t fully emptied your bladder BPH is much more common than prostate cancer It\u2019s difficult to tell the difference between the two conditions based on symptoms alone Be sure to tell your health care providers if you have any of these symptoms, because you may need special testing: Urinating frequently, especially at night Weak or intermittent urine stream Trouble urinating or straining to urinate Trouble holding in urine Feeling like your bladder hasn\u2019t fully emptied Dull pain in your groin or pelvis

treating advanced-stage prostate cancer Best practices come from the latest research and methods at top cancer centers Your treatment team should personalize your care following the best practices Many new tests and treatments are now available for advanced prostate cancer If possible, seek care or a second opinion from a medical center that specializes in prostate cancer Key points Prostate cancer develops when cells in the prostate gland grow out of control Age is the leading risk factor for prostate cancer As you age, your chances of developing prostate cancer increase Having a close family member with prostate cancer means that you have a higher chance of getting it yourself Everyone with a prostate is at risk for prostate cancer Black people and people with certain inherited genetic mutations are at greater risk Advanced-stage prostate cancer has spread outside the prostate to other areas in the body This spreading is called metastasis Advanced-stage prostate cancer is usually a life-long disease Treatment can slow it down, reduce its symptoms, and help people live longer. 2 Tests for advanced prostate cancer Common prostate tests General health history Diagnostic tests Genetic tests Tumor staging What\u2019s next Key points If you haven\u2019t yet been diagnosed with prostate cancer, you may need multiple tests and scans to find out if you have it and whether it has spread These tests and scans will help your team make the best plan to treat your prostate cancer Health care providers use a variety of tests to find prostate cancer and to determine how advanced the cancer is Tests are used to plan treatment, check how well treatment is working, and monitor your health after treatment ends This chapter describes what tests you might have and what to expect during testing Not every person with prostate cancer will receive every test listed here When you go for testing, bring someone with you to listen, ask questions, and write down the answers Common prostate tests Common prostate cancer tests are used to detect the possibility of prostate cancer in someone who\u2019s undiagnosed They\u2019re also used to check and monitor prostate cancer in patients who have been diagnosed Two common tests that look for prostate cancer are the PSA test and digital rectal exam PSA test This is a blood test that measures the amount of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in your bloodstream PSA is a protein made inside the prostate gland Its job is to help semen transport sperm All prostate cells, both normal cells and cancer cells, make PSA If there\u2019s something wrong with the prostate\u2014 like prostate cancer\u2014the prostate may make more PSA While most PSA goes into semen, a little bit ends up in the bloodstream, too An unusually high amount of PSA in the blood may be a sign of prostate cancer Likewise, an increase in PSA after treatment may indicate that the treatment is losing effectiveness However, age and other factors\u2014such as an enlarged prostate or a urinary tract infection\u2014 can also cause high levels of PSA This means that a PSA test by itself can\u2019t provide a diagnosis of prostate cancer That\u2019s why a PSA test is often paired with imaging or a digital rectal exam, or both, to decide whether you need a biopsy PSA level (also called total PSA) is measured in nanograms of PSA per milliliter of blood Digital rectal exam A digital rectal exam (also called a prostate exam) may be an awkward and unpleasant form of testing But it\u2019s the simplest and most direct way to check the size and texture of your prostate For this test, the doctor will insert a gloved finger into your rectum to feel your prostate for any signs of cancer An irregular or hardened part of the prostate could be a sign of a tumor Not all parts of the prostate can be felt during a digital rectal exam, though So it\u2019s usually paired with a PSA test and other factors\u2014 your age, race, family history, and more\u2014to determine whether you need further testing General health history Health history and physical exam Your care team needs to have all your health information They\u2019ll ask you about any health problems and treatments you\u2019ve had in your life Be prepared to talk about any illness or injury you\u2019ve had and when it happened Also tell your team about any symptoms

approach against a standard treatment If the results are good, it may be approved by the FDA Phase 4 trials study the long-term safety and benefit of an FDA-approved treatment Who can enroll Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called eligibility criteria The rules may be about age, cancer type and stage, treatment history, or general health These requirements ensure that participants are alike in specific ways and that the trial is as safe as possible for the participants Informed consent Clinical trials are managed by a group of experts called a research team The research team will review the study with you in detail, including its purpose and the risks and benefits of joining All of this information is also provided in an informed consent form Read the form carefully and ask questions before signing it Take time to discuss it with family, friends, or others you trust Keep in mind that you can leave and seek treatment outside of the clinical trial at any time Start the conversation Don\u2019t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical trials Start the conversation and learn about all of your treatment options If you find a study that you may be eligible for, ask your treatment team if you meet the requirements If you have already started standard treatment, you may not be eligible for certain clinical trials Try not to be discouraged if you cannot join New clinical trials are always becoming available Frequently asked questions There are many myths and misconceptions surrounding clinical trials The possible benefits and risks are not well understood by many with cancer Will I get a placebo Placebos (inactive versions of real medicines) are almost never used alone in cancer clinical trials It is common to receive either a placebo with a standard treatment or a new drug with a standard treatment You will be informed, verbally and in writing, if a placebo is part of a clinical trial before you enroll Are clinical trials free There is no fee to enroll in a clinical trial The study sponsor pays for research-related costs, including the study drug You may, however, have costs indirectly related to the trial, such as the cost of transportation or child care due to extra appointments During the trial, you will continue to receive standard cancer care This care is billed to\u2014and often covered by\u2014 insurance You are responsible for

of FL Key points Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a slow-growing (indolent) nonHodgkin lymphoma (NHL) NHLs develop from B lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell In FL, excess amounts of abnormal B lymphocytes form clusters (follicles) in the lymph nodes and sometimes other tissues Lymphatic system Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) begins in the lymphatic system The lymphatic or lymph system is a major part of the body\u2019s immune system It is a germ- and cancer-fighting network of tissues and organs that includes the bone marrow, spleen, thymus, lymph nodes, and lymphatic vessels Lymphatic vessels are a network of thin tubes that carry lymphatic fluid (lymph) and white blood cells into all the tissues of the body White blood cells, such as lymphocytes cells, help fight infection and other diseases Lymphatic system The lymphatic or lymph system is part of the immune system It includes lymph vessels, lymph nodes, tonsils, thymus, spleen, and bone marrow As lymph travels throughout your body, it passes through hundreds of small beanshaped structures called lymph nodes Lymph nodes make immune cells that help the body fight infection They also filter the lymph fluid and remove foreign material such as bacteria and cancer cells Lymphocytes Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a cancer of lymphocytes A lymphocyte is a type of white blood cell that helps fight and prevent infection Lymphocytes are found in blood and lymph tissue, and every organ in the body Lymph tissue includes lymph vessels and lymph nodes Lymphocytes normally grow in response to infection or inflammation When they grow on their own without proper regulation, they can develop into lymphoma Germinal centers Follicular lymphoma (FL) starts in the temporary germinal centers (GCs) of lymph nodes These germinal centers are short-lived structures that form in response to infection or inflammation When B cells within germinal centers grow out of control, it can form FL There are 3 main types of lymphocytes: B lymphocytes or B cells make antibodies An antibody is a protein that specifically targets infections or cancer cells and recruits other parts of the immune system T lymphocytes or T cells help fight infections, cancer, and control immune responses Natural killer (NK) cells can kill tumor cells or virus-infected cells Follicular lymphoma starts in mature B cells Follicular lymphoma Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) It is a slow-dividing, slow-growing B-cell lymphoma that typically forms tumors in lymph nodes However, FL can form tumors in other parts of the body such as the bone marrow This is called extranodal (outside of the lymph node) disease Not everyone with FL needs treatment right away How does FL develop In lymph nodes, temporary germinal centers (GCs) form in response to an immune stressor such as infection or inflammation This is normal But, when cells within germinal centers grow without proper regulation, it can develop into FL In FL, excess amounts of abnormal B lymphocytes group together to form clusters (follicles) in the lymph nodes It might be helpful to know that these short-lived germinal centers are different than those found in some subtypes of Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) There are 2 zones in the germinal center: light and dark B cells in the light zone are called centrocytes They are smaller, less in number, and divide less than B cells in the dark zone B cells within the dark zone are called centroblasts They are larger than the cells in the light zone and reproduce (divide) more The types of cells found in your FL help determine the grade, which then determines the stage The stage tells if your cancer should be treated as classic FL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, transformed FL, or individualized Grading The types of cells found in your FL help determine the grade Grades include 1, 2, 3A, and 3B Grade 3B contains only centroblasts (large cells), while the other grades contain mixtures of centrocytes (small cells) and centroblasts (large cells) The more centroblasts, the higher the grade The grade helps tell how your lymphoma should be treated Two

it MRI scans take longer to perform than CT scans PET scan A PET (positron emission tomography) scan uses a radioactive drug called a tracer A tracer is a substance injected into a vein to see where cancer cells are in the body and how much sugar is being taken up by the cancer cells This gives an idea about how fast the cancer cells are growing Cancer cells show up as bright spots on PET scans However, not all tumors will appear on a PET scan Also, not all bright spots found on the PET scan are cancer It is normal for the brain, heart, kidneys, and bladder to be bright on PET Inflammation or infection can also show up as a bright spot When a PET scan is combined with CT, it is called a PET/CT scan An FDG-PET/CT uses a radiotracer called fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) Heart tests Heart or

a heart specialist called a cardiologist Electrocardiogram An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) shows electrical changes in your heart It reveals information about your heart rate and rhythm A prolonged corrected QT interval (or QTc) occurs when your heart muscle takes longer than normal to recharge between beats Certain treatments can cause a prolonged QTc If the QTc becomes too prolonged, it can cause dangerous heart rhythms Echocardiogram An echocardiogram (or echo) uses sound waves to make pictures It is a type of ultrasound For this test, small patches will be placed on your chest to track your heartbeat Next, a wand with gel on its tip will be slid across part of your bare chest A picture of your beating heart will be seen on a screen The pictures will be recorded for future viewing An echocardiogram shows the structure (valves and muscle thickness) and function of your heart (or ejection fraction) Ejection fraction is the amount of blood pumped out of the left side of your heart every time it beats If the amount of blood pumping from the left side of the heart is lower than normal, this indicates decreased heart function. 66 It is important to understand what you are going through If your doctor says something you do not understand, let them know 'I don\u2019t fully understand what this means' or 'I don\u2019t fully understand what you just said Can you please explain it in simpler terms?' This is an important way of advocating for yourself.\" Lumbar puncture Leukemia can travel to the fluid that surrounds the spine or brain This may cause symptoms such as headaches, neck pain, and sensitivity to light A test may be needed to know if leukemia cells are in your spinal fluid A lumbar puncture (LP) is a procedure that removes spinal fluid by inserting a needle into the middle of the lower back It is also called a spinal tap Key points In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), abnormal changes stop very immature white blood cells called myeloid blasts or myeloblasts from becoming mature blood cells As a result, there is a buildup of blasts in the bone marrow and blood making it hard for blood to do its work An aspirate or biopsy is the removal of a sample of tissue or group of cells for testing A diagnosis of AML is confirmed using a bone marrow aspirate and bone marrow biopsy In general, to be diagnosed with AML, 20 percent or more myeloblasts must be present in the bone marrow or blood This means that at least 1 out of every 5 cells are blasts", "extracted_entities": ["leukemia", "MRI", "CT scans", "PET", "positron emission tomography", "FDG-PET/CT",

CBCL appears as a nodule under the skin that might look like small pimples called papules Lymphatic system Lymphoma is the most common type of blood cancer It affects the lymphatic system The lymphatic or lymph system is a major part of the body\u2019s immune system It is a germfighting network of tissues and organs that includes the bone marrow, spleen, thymus, lymph nodes, and lymphatic vessels Lymphatic vessels are a network of thin tubes that carry lymphatic fluid (lymph) and white blood cells into all the tissues of the body Lymph gives cells water and food White blood cells, such as lymphocytes, help fight infection and disease Lymphatic system The lymphatic or lymph system is part of the immune system It includes lymph vessels, lymph nodes, tonsils, thymus, spleen, and bone marrow As lymph travels throughout your body, it passes through hundreds of small beanshaped structures called lymph nodes Lymph nodes make immune cells that help the body fight infection They also filter the lymph fluid and remove foreign material such as bacteria and cancer cells Lymphocytes Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a cancer of lymphocytes A lymphocyte is a type of white blood cell that helps fight and prevent infection Lymphocytes are found in blood and lymph tissue, and every organ in the body Lymph tissue includes lymph vessels and lymph nodes Lymphocytes normally grow in response to infection or inflammation When they grow on their own without proper regulation, they can develop into lymphoma There are 3 main types of lymphocytes: B lymphocytes or B cells make antibodies An antibody is a protein that fights infection. h T lymphocytes or T cells help kill tumor cells and help control immune responses Natural killer (NK) cells have granules (small particles) with enzymes that can kill tumor cells or cells infected with a virus Primary cutaneous lymphomas Primary cutaneous lymphomas (PCL) or lymphomas of the skin are a rare group of NHLs PCL is not a type of skin cancer Skin cancer develops from skin cells PCL develops from abnormal B or T lymphocytes A lymphocyte is a type of white blood cell There are 2 types of PCL: Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma (CBCL) Cutaneous B-cell lymphomas Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma (CBCL) develops from abnormal B cells B cells produce antibodies that are used to attack invading bacteria, viruses, and toxins The antibody molecules latch onto and destroy invading viruses or bacteria CBCL often appears as nodules under the skin that might look like small pimples called papules Main types include: Primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma (PCMZL), also called PCMZ lymphoproliferative disorder Primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma (PCFCL) Primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg type (PC-DLBCL, leg type) Most primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas (PCBCLs) are indolent or slow-growing This book will discuss treatment options for the following CBCLs: PCMZL (PCMZ lymphoproliferative disorder) PCFCL Treatment for PC-DLBCL, leg type can be found in NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphomas at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient

Polyps Key points Colon cancer is common and treatable Many cancers that start in the colon can be cured, especially when found early The colon The colon makes up most of the large intestine (bowel) In the colon water is absorbed from eaten food, turning it into feces or stool After leaving the colon, stool moves into the rectum The rectum is the last 6 inches or so of the large bowel Stool is held here until it leaves the body through an opening called the anus The colon The start of the colon is a pouch called the cecum Sticking out from the cecum is the appendix This skinny tube is about the size of a finger and is closed at one end The rest of the colon has 4 main sections: the ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid colon The term colorectal cancer is used to describe cancers that form in either the colon or rectum While these cancers are similar, their treatment is different The focus of this guide is colon cancer For information on rectal cancer treatment, see the NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Rectal Cancer at NCCN.org/ patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app Polyps Polyps are non-cancerous growths that form on the inner lining of the colon and rectum The most common type is called an adenoma While it may take many years, adenomas can become invasive colon cancer Cancer that forms in an adenoma is called an adenocarcinoma This is the most common type of colon cancer Polyps that rarely turn into cancer include hyperplastic and inflammatory polyps While most polyps do not become cancer, almost all colon cancers start in a polyp Removing polyps can prevent cancer before it starts Most can be removed during a colonoscopy using a minor surgical procedure called a polypectomy Polyps can also be tested to make sure that cancer has not already started to develop For more information, see the NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Colorectal Cancer Screening at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app Key points This guide discusses the following key topics about colon cancer diagnosis and treatment Testing and treatment planning h Testing the tumor for a biomarker (feature) called mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) h Treatment planning based on mismatch repair status and results of other testing Non-metastatic cancer Treatment for polyps with cancer Colectomy (surgery) for non-metastatic colon cancer Chemotherapy after colectomy (for all stage 3 cancers and some stage 2 cancers) Metastatic cancer h Expanded biomarker testing to identify targetable features of the cancer The use of local therapies to treat liver and lung tumors h Systemic therapy for metastatic cancer Survivorship Help for long-term side effects Maintaining healthy habits Resources 2 Testing and treatment planning Mismatch repair testing Family health history Blood tests Imaging Fertility and family planning Key points This chapter describes testing and other care needed to create your treatment plan All colon cancers should be tested for mutations (changes) in genes that fix damaged DNA, called mismatch repair (MMR) genes Most colon cancers are found during colonoscopy It is common to have another colonoscopy to thoroughly examine the colon and look for other possible areas of cancer This is called a diagnostic colonoscopy Mismatch repair testing Mismatch repair (MMR) or microsatellite instability (MSI) testing is recommended for everyone diagnosed with colon cancer This feature of some colon cancers is a type of biomarker Biomarkers are targetable changes of a cancer that help guide your treatment Testing involves analyzing a piece of the colon tumor in a lab Depending on the method used, an abnormal result is called either microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) Tumors that do not have these changes are referred to as microsatellite stable (MSS) or mismatch repair proficient (pMMR) If the cancer is dMMR/MSI-H, you will also be tested for an inherited condition called Lynch syndrome, described next Family health history Your doctor will ask about the health history of your biological (related by blood) family members Those with a first-degree relative with colorectal cancer are more likely to have this cancer compared to the average person Most colon cancers occur for unknown reasons While rare, some people are born with a disorder that makes them more likely to get colon and other cancers These are called inherited cancer syndromes Two such conditions include Lynch syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis

lymphoma 8 What can you do to get the best care Hodgkin lymphoma is a highly curable cancer that usually starts in lymph nodes in the upper body Most people are diagnosed between the ages of 15 to 30, or after age What is lymphoma Lymphoma is cancer that begins when white blood cells called lymphocytes grow out of control Lymphomas are described as either Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin Non-Hodgkin lymphomas are a large and varied group of cancers When viewed under a microscope, Hodgkin lymphoma cells look different than other lymphomas The lymphocytes are abnormally large and may have more than one nucleus These oversized lymphocytes are called ReedSternberg cells The focus of this resource is Hodgkin lymphoma in adults Information on Hodgkin lymphoma in children and adolescents is available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app What is the lymphatic system The lymphatic system is part of your immune system It helps your body fight infection and disease The tissues and organs that make up the lymphatic system are described next They are made mostly of lymphocytes There are other types of white blood cells, but lymphocytes are the most important to understanding Hodgkin lymphoma Lymph and lymphatic vessels There is a super-highway of ducts running through your body These ducts are called lymphatic vessels Much like how blood vessels transport blood, lymphatic vessels transport lymph Lymph is a clear fluid that carries infection-fighting white blood cells (lymphocytes) throughout the body It is also called lymphatic fluid Lymph

show if there is a mass in the ovary and whether the mass is solid or filled with fluid The 2 types of ultrasounds that may be used to look for ovarian cancer are described next Both are done using a hand-held device called an ultrasound probe Ultrasounds are generally painless, but you may feel some discomfort when the probe is inserted For a transabdominal ultrasound, a gel will be spread on your abdomen and pelvis The gel helps to make the pictures clearer Your doctor will place the probe on your skin and guide it back and forth in the gel For a transvaginal ultrasound, your doctor will insert the probe into your vagina This may help the doctor see your ovaries more clearly Transvaginal ultrasound Ultrasound uses sound waves to make pictures of the inside of the body For a transvaginal ultrasound, a probe is inserted into the vagina Ultrasounds are generally painless, but you may feel some discomfort when the probe is inserted CT Imaging to look for ovarian cancer may include computed tomography (CT) scans of your abdomen, pelvis, and chest CT scans are good at showing if the cancer has spread outside of the ovaries They may also show if nearby lymph nodes are bigger than normal This can be a sign that the cancer has spread If you can have it, a substance called contrast is used to make the pictures clearer Before the scan you will be asked to drink a large glass of oral contrast A contrast agent will also be injected into your vein It may cause you to feel flushed or get hives Rarely, allergic reactions can occur Tell your team if you've had an allergic reaction to contrast in the past A CT scanner is a large machine with a tunnel in the middle While you lie on a table that moves through the tunnel, the scanner will rotate an x-ray beam around you to take pictures from many angles MRI If the ultrasound images are unclear, you may have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of your abdomen and pelvis An MRI of your chest or liver may be used to look for signs of cancer spread MRI doesn\u2019t use radiation It uses radio waves and powerful magnets to take pictures of areas inside the body Getting an MRI scan is similar to getting a CT scan but takes longer Like a CT scan, a contrast agent may be used to make the pictures clearer You will lie on a table that moves through a large tunnel in the scanning machine The machine is more enclosed than a CT scan Tell your care team if you get nervous in enclosed spaces You may be given a type of medicine called a sedative to help you relax CT scan A CT scan is a more detailed kind of -ray It takes a lot of pictures, or images, from different angles A computer then combines the images to make 3-D pictures PET CT or MRI are sometimes combined with positron emission tomography (PET) A PET scan shows how your cells are using a simple form of sugar, which can be helpful for identifying cancer A sugar radiotracer is put into your body through a vein The radiotracer puts out a small amount of energy that is detected by the machine that takes pictures Cancer cells appear brighter because they use sugar faster than normal cells PET is very good at showing small groups of cancer cells This test may also be useful for showing if ovarian cancer has spread Chest x-ray A chest -ray can show if cancer has spread to your lungs It may be ordered with other tests when ovarian cancer is first suspected or found It may also be used to check treatment results A chest x-ray is fast and painless and uses small amounts of radiation Diagnostic laparoscopy If the cancer is advanced, you may have a diagnostic laparoscopy before treatment The goal is to learn how much cancer is in the abdomen It helps your doctors to decide whether surgery can be the first treatment, or if chemotherapy is needed first This minimally invasive procedure involves making a tiny cut in the abdomen A thin tube with a light and a camera (laparoscope) is used to view the lining of the abdomen and the surface of

are recommended for all other stage 1 tumors The specific number of cycles needed depends on the tumor type and other factors Stages 2, 3, and 4 For common tumor types, chemotherapy is recommended after surgery for all newly diagnosed stage 2, 3, and 4 ovarian cancers At this time, the preferred chemotherapy regimen is paclitaxel with carboplatin, given every 3 weeks Six cycles are given for stage 2, 3, and 4 cancers If you can't have this regimen, there are other recommended options A drug called bevacizumab (Avastin) may be added to your chemotherapy It stops the growth of new blood vessels that feed the tumor If chemotherapy works well, the next step may include maintenance therapy See page 31 for more information How chemotherapy is given Most chemotherapy for ovarian cancer is given intravenously This means the medicine is put directly into your bloodstream through a vein You may get a port to receive chemotherapy This is a small, round disc that is usually placed under your skin in the upper chest It is inserted during a minor surgery and stays in the body until treatment is complete After treatment the port can be easily removed Once the port is removed, the skin will heal Chemotherapy medicine can also be slowly injected into the abdomen This is called intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy When given this way, higher doses of the drugs are delivered directly to the cancer cells in the belly area IP chemotherapy is given through a thin tube called a catheter The catheter is usually connected to a port placed inside the abdomen during surgery Monitoring during chemotherapy Your doctor will monitor how well the chemotherapy is working and assess for side effects Expect to have a physical exam every 1 to 3 cycles A pelvic and rectovaginal exam may be done at the same time Imaging and blood tests are ordered as needed Testing for CA-125 or other tumor markers may be performed before each cycle of chemotherapy Side effects of chemotherapy Common side effects of chemotherapy include: Loss of appetite Nausea and vomiting Mouth sores Hair loss Fatigue Increased risk of infection Bleeding or bruising easily Nerve damage (neuropathy) The side effects of chemotherapy depend on the specific medicines being used, the dose, and other factors In general, side effects are caused by the death of fast-growing cells, Side effects Managing side effects is a shared effort between you and your care team It is important to speak up about bothersome side effects, such as nausea and vomiting Ask about your options for managing or relieving the effects of

What's in this book? 7 What can you do to get the best care Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of blood cancer that starts in the stem cells of bone marrow There are many subtypes of AML found in adults This chapter will provide an overview of AML What is AML In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), abnormal changes stop very immature white blood cells called myeloid blasts or myeloblasts from becoming mature blood cells As a result, there is a buildup of blasts in the bone marrow and blood In turn, there are not enough healthy red blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells This causes serious health issues For this reason, AML is fatal if left untreated Subtypes of AML There are many subtypes of AML They are grouped and treated based on the presence or absence of certain gene mutations or abnormal chromosomes and other factors In addition to AML, this book includes information about the following: Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) Why you should read this book Making decisions about cancer care can be stressful You may need to make tough decisions under pressure about complex choices The NCCN Guidelines for Patients are trusted by patients and providers They clearly explain current care recommendations made by respected experts in the field Recommendations are based on the latest research and practices

Use this book as your guide to find the information you need to make important decisions What is blood AML is a type of blood cancer Blood is a tissue A tissue is a group of cells that work together to perform a function Blood\u2019s function is to move oxygen and nutrients throughout your body and carry away waste Blood also plays an important role for the immune system and in preventing bleeding There are 4 main components of blood\u2014plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets Types of blood cells Your blood contains different types of cells that float in plasma Plasma is a clear, yellowish fluid made up of mostly water There are 3 types of blood cells: Red blood cells (RBCs or erythrocytes) carry oxygen throughout the body White blood cells (WBCs or leukocytes) fight infections WBCs include granulocytes (or neutrophils), monocytes, and lymphocytes Platelets (PLTs or thrombocytes) help control bleeding How are blood cells formed Bone marrow is the organ that creates blood in our body It is the sponge-like tissue in the center of most bones Inside your bone marrow are early blood-forming cells called blood (hematopoietic) stem cells Stem cells multiply to maintain a supply throughout our lifetime Some of these stem cells gradually develop into blood cells through a process called differentiation At any given time, the bone marrow contains cells at various stages of development, from very immature to nearly mature Once a blood stem cell fully develops into a red blood cell, white blood cell, or platelet, it is released into the bloodstream as needed Blood cell formation All blood cells start as blood stem cells A blood stem cell has to mature or go through many stages to become a red blood cell, white blood cell, or platelet

translocation between chromosomes 11 and 22 is written as t(11;22) and is common in Ewing sarcoma Ewing sarcoma is characterized by the fusion of the EWS gene (EWSR1) on chromosome 22 with various members of the ETS gene family (FLI1, ERG, ETV1, ETV4, and FEV), with FLI1 being the most common Almost everyone with Ewing sarcoma will have one of the possible gene fusions This is not inherited from your birth parents but results from an error of cell division while your tissues were growing This is called a somatic mutation or somatic change MSI-H/dMMR mutation Microsatellites are short, repeated strings of DNA When errors or defects occur, they are fixed by mismatch repair (MMR) proteins Some cancers have DNA mutations or changes that prevent these errors from being fixed This is called microsatellite instability (MSI) or deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) When cancer cells have more than a normal number of microsatellites, it is called MSI-H (microsatellite instability-high) This is often due to dMMR genes Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) is often used to treat MSI-H/dMMR tumors Tumor mutational burden When there are 10 or more mutations per million base pairs of tumor DNA, it is called tumor mutational burden-high (TMB-H) Pembrolizumab (Keytruda), nivolumab (Opdivo), or ipilimumab (Yervoy) might be used for TMB-H tumors in some cases Tumor mutation testing Tumor mutation testing or tumor genomic aberration testing uses a sample of your tumor or blood to see if the cancer cells have any specific DNA mutations This is a different type of DNA testing than the genetic testing for mutations you may have inherited from your birth parents In tumor mutation testing, only the tumor is tested and not the rest of your body Mutation testing uses methods such as nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) IDH1 mutation Some gene mutations such as IDH1 can be targeted with specific therapies such as ivosidenib (Tibsovo) Ivosidenib is for those with chondrosarcoma who are prone to have IDH1 mutations Next-generation sequencing Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a method used to determine a portion of a person\u2019s DNA sequence It shows if a gene has any mutations that might affect how the gene works NGS looks at the gene in a more detailed way than other methods and can find mutations that other methods might miss PCR A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a technique that can make millions or billions of copies of your DNA or RNA (genetic information) PCR is very sensitive It can find 1 abnormal cell among more than 100,000 normal cells These copies, called PCR products, might be used for NGS. \"Be your own advocate Talk to someone who has gone through the same thing as you Ask a lot of questions, even the ones

treatment for metastatic anal cancer is usually to help you live longer and to help with symptoms Detailed treatment information is provided in Part 2: Treatment guide Because anal cancer is rare and stigmatized, it is harder to find others who have been through it Get yourself a mentor, and when you recover, pay it forward by mentoring someone else. \u2013 Michael Anal cancer survivor Fertility and family planning Anal cancer treatment almost always involves radiation therapy Radiation therapy can cause or contribute to infertility, which is the inability to produce children Radiation damages the ovaries and causes them to stop making hormones needed for natural pregnancy Chemotherapy can also cause infertility in some cases by damaging sperm or eggs If you want the option of having children after treatment or are unsure, tell your doctor There are ways to be able to have children after cancer treatment This is called fertility preservation If you are of childbearing age, your doctor will discuss any fertilityrelated risks of your treatment plan with you You may be referred for counseling about fertility preservation options Some fertility preservation options are described below Sperm banking Sperm banking stores semen for later use by freezing it in liquid nitrogen The medical term for this is semen cryopreservation Egg freezing Like sperm banking, unfertilized eggs can be removed, frozen, and stored for later use The medical term for this is oocyte cryopreservation Ovarian tissue banking This method involves removing part or all of an ovary and freezing the part that contains the eggs The frozen tissue that contains the eggs can later be unfrozen and put back in the body Ovarian transposition This procedure moves one or both ovaries and fallopian tubes out of the range of the radiation beam The medical term for this procedure is oophoropexy For more information on this topic, see the NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Adolescents and

starts in either the anal cana or the perianal region The anal canal is the small section of bowel between the rectum and the anus The perianal region includes the anal opening and the skin directly surrounding it The most common type of anal cancer is squamous cell carcinoma It starts in squamous cells, which are found in the tissues that form the surface of the skin and in other areas of the body The risk factor most strongly linked with anal cancer is long-term infection with HPV HPV is an extremely common sexually transmitted virus Other risk factors for anal cancer include HIV infection, immunosuppressant use, a history of certain cancers or pre-cancers, certain autoimmune disorders, smoking, and a history of anal sex or sexually transmitted infection. h Recommended testing

replacement therapy used for menopause There is one type of surgical endocrine therapy: Bilateral oophorectomy is surgery to remove both ovaries Other main types of endocrine therapy include: Ovarian ablation uses radiation to permanently stop the ovaries from making hormones Ovarian suppression uses drugs to temporarily stop the ovaries from making hormones It is achieved with drugs called LHRH agonists These drugs stop LHRH from being made, which stops the ovaries from making hormones LHRH agonists include goserelin (Zoladex) and leuprolide (Lupron Depot) Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists might be used to suppress ovarian hormone or testosterone production. h Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) stop a type of hormone called androgen from changing into estrogen by interfering with an enzyme called aromatase They do not affect estrogen made by the ovaries Non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors include anastrozole (Arimidex) and letrozole (Femara) Exemestane (Aromasin) is a steroidal aromatase inhibitor Estrogen receptor (ER) modulators or anti-estrogens prevent hormones from binding to receptors SERMs and SERDs are types of ER modulators. \u2022 Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) block estrogen from attaching to hormone receptors They include tamoxifen and toremifene (Fareston). \u2022 Selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs) block and destroy

started in the cells that line the milk ducts and has spread into surrounding tissue Breast cancer Breast cancer starts in the cells of the breast Almost all breast cancers are a subtype called carcinomas Carcinomas are cancers that start in the cells that line the inner or outer surfaces of the body There are different types of breast carcinoma The most common types are either ductal or lobular Ductal carcinoma starts in the cells that line the milk ducts Milk ducts are thin tubes that carry milk from the lobules of the breast to the nipple It is the most common type of breast cancer Lobular carcinoma starts in the lobules (milk glands) of the breast It is the second most common type of breast cancer Inflammatory breast cancer Most inflammatory breast cancers (IBCs) are invasive ductal carcinomas This means that cancer started in the cells that line the milk ducts and has spread into surrounding tissue It\u2019s important not to dismiss any strange skin changes to the breast,

has an orange-peel texture) Edema (swelling caused by excess fluid in body tissue) Erythema (reddening of the skin, usually in patches) Inflammatory breast cancer In inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), cancer cells block lymph vessels in the skin of the breast This causes the breast to look red and swollen and feel warm to the touch Like other breast cancers, IBC can happen in those assigned male at birth Although there are some differences between those assigned male and those assigned female at birth, treatment is very similar for all genders Key points Anyone can develop breast cancer, but breast cancer occurs more frequently in persons assigned female at birth Inside breasts are lobules, ducts, fat, blood and lymph vessels, ligaments, and connective tissue Lobules are structures that make breast milk Ducts carry breast milk from the lobules to the nipple Breast cancer often starts in the ducts or lobules and then spreads into the surrounding tissue In inflammatory breast cancer

Genetic risk testing Distress screening Key points Treatment planning starts with testing This chapter presents an overview of the tests you might receive and what to expect IBC can be difficult to diagnose Often, there is no lump that can be felt during a breast exam or seen on a mammogram Since there is swelling (edema) and redness (erythema) of the breast, IBC can look like an infection and therefore be difficult to diagnose Often, a biopsy of the affected skin is done to diagnose the tumor Test results You will have blood tests, imaging tests, and a biopsy to stage the cancer The biopsy sample will be tested for hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone) and HER2 receptors Treatment will be based on these findings It is important you understand what these tests mean Ask questions and keep copies of your test results Online patient portals are a great way to access your test results Keep these things in mind: Choose a friend, family member, or peer who can drive you to appointments, provide meals, or offer emotional support during diagnosis and treatment Bring someone with you to doctor visits, if possible Write down questions and take notes during appointments

doctor will discuss the results with you While these reports are available to you through your patient portal, please wait to discuss these results with the doctor The following imaging tests are not in order of importance You will not have all of these tests Bone scan A bone scan uses a radiotracer A radiotracer is a substance that releases small amounts of radiation Before the pictures are taken, the tracer will be injected into your vein It can take a few hours for the tracer to enter your bones However, the test is quick and painless A special camera will take pictures of the tracer in your bones as it moves over your body Areas of bone damage take up more radiotracer than healthy bone and show up as bright spots on the pictures Bone damage can be caused by cancer, cancer treatment, previous injuries, or other health issues Bone x-ray An x-ray uses low-dose radiation to take one picture at a time A tumor changes the way radiation is absorbed and will show up on the x-ray X-rays are also good at showing bone issues Your care team may order x-rays if your bones hurt or were abnormal on a bone scan Diagnostic mammogram A mammogram is a picture of the insides of your breast The pictures are made using x-rays A computer combines the x-rays to make detailed pictures A bilateral mammogram includes pictures of both breasts Mammogram results are used to plan treatment Diagnostic mammograms look at specific areas of your breasts, which may not be clearly seen on screening mammograms They are used to see tumor and the size of the tumor(s) Diagnostic mammograms include extra compression in certain areas of the breast, magnification views, or rolling the breast to image additional areas of the breast Other tests may include a breast MRI or ultrasound MRI scan A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan uses radio waves and powerful magnets to take pictures of the inside of the body It does not use x-rays Because of the very strong magnets used in the MRI machine, tell the technologist if you have any metal in your body During the test, you will likely be asked to hold your breath for 10 to 20 seconds as the technician collects the images Contrast is often used A closed MRI has a capsule-like design where the magnet surrounds you An open MRI has a magnetic top and bottom, which allows for an opening on each end Closed MRIs are more common than open MRIs, so if you have claustrophobia (a dread or fear of enclosed spaces), be sure to talk to your care team about it Breast MRI If needed, a breast MRI will be used in addition to a mammogram Contrast should be used You will be positioned face down in the machine with your arms above your head Spine and brain MRI An MRI can be used to detect breast cancer that has spread (metastasize) to your spine or brain For a brain MRI, a device is placed around your head For a spine MRI, no device is worn Contrast should be used in an MRI CT scan A computed tomography (CT or CAT) scan uses x-rays and computer technology to take pictures of the inside of the body It takes many x-rays of the same body part from different angles All the images are combined to make one detailed picture Intravenous (IV) contrast is often used Contrast material Contrast material is used to improve the pictures of the inside of the body Contrast materials are not dyes, but substances that help

feelings can also change from day to day and week to week Talk to your care team and those whom you feel most comfortable about how you are feeling There are services and people who can help you Support and counseling are available Many treatment teams include mind and body therapists who can help Dealing with a cancer diagnosis can be stressful and may cause further distress Distress is an unpleasant experience of a mental, physical, social, or spiritual nature It can affect how you feel, think, and act Distress might include feelings of sadness, fear, helplessness, worry, anger, and guilt You may also experience depression, anxiety, and sleep issues Your treatment team will screen your level of distress This is part of your cancer care Your diagnosis of cancer may affect your family or loved ones They may feel some degree of anxiety or depression They can talk to the social worker and seek help, too Endocrine tests Radiation therapy to the head and neck can affect

depending on the extent of the surgery Premature menopause If you have not entered menopause, surgery that removes both ovaries will cause it This is known as surgical menopause It is caused by the sudden drop in estrogen in the body This drop can cause symptoms of menopause, including: Hot flashes Sleeping problems Night sweats Weight gain Changes in mood Thinning, drying, and irritation of the vaginal lining (vaginal atrophy) When caused by surgery, the symptoms of menopause may be sudden and more severe There are also long-term risks of not having enough estrogen They include heart or blood vessel problems (cardiovascular disease) and bone loss (osteoporosis) If you have symptoms of surgical menopause, your doctor may suggest non-hormonal medicine or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) Discussion with a menopausal symptom team is recommended to determine whether HRT is right for you Other risks and side effects With any type of surgery, there are health risks and side effects Common side effects include pain, swelling, and scars Common side effects of ovarian cancer surgery include leg swelling, trouble urinating, and constipation Cancer and recent abdominal surgery are risk factors for developing blood clots, also known as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) Many patients are placed on blood thinners (either oral medications or injections) for up to 4 weeks after surgery to help prevent blood clots If surgery first isn\u2019t an option Having surgery first may not be an option This could be due to the size or location of the tumor, other health conditions, or your overall health In this case, chemotherapy is given first to shrink the cancer You will need a biopsy to confirm that the tumor is ovarian cancer before starting chemotherapy At this time, preferred regimens include: h Paclitaxel and carboplatin Paclitaxel, carboplatin, bevacizumab, and maintenance bevacizumab While the above regimens are preferred, there are other recommended options for chemotherapy Your team will take into account any medical conditions and your overall health These regimens may change as new information becomes available After a few cycles of chemotherapy (2 to 3 months), your doctor will check to see how well chemotherapy worked and if surgery is an option The goal of surgery is to remove as much of the cancer as possible, as well as the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and uterus Surgery performed after chemotherapy is called interval cytoreductive surgery (ICS) For stage 3 disease, hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) may be used during ICS HIPEC is a technique in which chemotherapy is warmed and then circulated in the spaces between the organs of the abdomen during surgery If cancer improves after several cycles of chemotherapy, surgery is usually recommended If cancer stays the same, your doctor may recommend proceeding with surgery or continuing chemotherapy to see if there is improvement After surgery, more chemotherapy is usually given Maintenance therapy may follow once your cancer is in remission Staging The information gained during surgery and surgical staging is used to determine the pathologic (post-surgery) stage The pathologic stage provides the most accurate picture of how far the cancer has spread It is used to guide treatment after surgery A staging system is a standard way of describing the extent of cancer in the body There are 2 staging systems for ovarian cancer One was developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), the other by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) They are similar but the FIGO system is used most often In the FIGO system, the cancer stage is defined by 3 main areas of cancer growth: The extent of the first (primary) tumor The spread of cancer to nearby lymph nodes The spread of cancer to distant sites Ovarian cancer stages are numbered from 1 to Doctors write cancer stages as I, II, III, and IV The stages are also divided into smaller groups, called substages This helps to describe the extent of cancer in more detail The FIGO stages of ovarian cancer are described on the following pages Cancers of the same stage tend to have similar outcomes Early-stage cancers tend to have better outcomes than more advanced cancers Other factors not used for staging, such as your general health, are also important Stage 1A Cancer is

thing about bladder cancer is whether the tumor has or hasn\u2019t grown into the bladder muscle Cancer in stage 0 and stage 1 haven\u2019t grown into the muscle layer (non\u2013 muscle-invasive) Cancer in stages 2, 3, and 4 have grown into the muscle layer (muscleinvasive) Cancer that has invaded the muscle layer needs more intense treatment Stage 0 Stage 0 is the earliest stage of bladder cancer This stage of cancer affects only the inner lining of the bladder (urothelial layer) Stage 0 has two subgroups: Stage 0a describes cancer cells that grow from the inner lining toward the hollow center of the bladder, rather than into the bladder wall Stage 0is stands for carcinoma in situ (CIS) This is a flat patch of cancer cells that hasn\u2019t grown any farther than where it started It\u2019s still on the surface of the bladder lining and has yet to invade deeper layers However, carcinoma in situ is fast-growing, aggressive, and can be very serious Stage 1 Stage 1 has grown through the inner lining of the bladder wall and into the layer of connective tissue But stage 1 hasn\u2019t invaded the muscle layer of the bladder wall (non\u2013 muscle-invasive) Stage 2 Stage 2 bladder cancer has grown into the muscle layer (muscle-invasive), but it hasn\u2019t reached the fatty layer covering the outside of the bladder nor has it spread anywhere else Stage 3 Stage 3 has grown through the bladder wall and into the fatty layer surrounding the bladder It may also have spread to lymph nodes and organs nearby (in the pelvis) Stage 3 has two subgroups: Stage 3A bladder cancer may only be in the fatty tissue surrounding the bladder or it may have spread to a single nearby lymph node It may also invade nearby reproductive organs such as the prostate gland, uterus, or vagina Stage 3A cancer has not spread to nodes or organs that are far from the bladder Stage 3B has the same traits as stage 3A but has spread to multiple lymph nodes in the pelvis Stage 3B cancer has not spread to lymph nodes or organs far from the bladder Stage 4 Stage 4 cancer has grown through the bladder wall and may have spread to lymph nodes or organs far from the bladder Stage 4 has two subgroups: Stage 4A has invaded the wall of the pelvis or abdomen Or, it has spread to lymph nodes far from the bladder Stage 4B has spread to far away lymph nodes and organs like the bones, liver, or lungs Stage 4B is metastatic bladder cancer Grade Subtypes The next piece of information used to plan treatment is the cancer grade The grade measures how aggressive the cancer is It\u2019s a rating of how fast the cancer will likely grow and spread To figure out the grade, a sample of your tumor will be studied in a laboratory by a pathologist The pathologist will compare the cancer cells to normal cells The more different they look, the higher the grade And the higher the grade, the faster the cancer is expected to spread LG means that the cancer cells are low grade (slow growing) HG means that the cancer cells are high grade (fast growing) The inner lining of the bladder is made of urothelial cells Most cases of bladder cancer start in the urothelial cells So this type of cancer is called urothelial cancer But in rare cases, urothelial cell cancer has features that look like other types of cells These are referred to as subtypes Some of them include: Glandular subtype Squamous cell subtype Micropapillary subtype Plasmacytoid subtype Sarcomatoid subtype Nested subtype Lymphoepithelioma-like subtype Microcystic and tubular subtype It\u2019s important to investigate whether you have one of these or another subtype In general, treatment for these uncommon subtypes is similar in the early stages to treatment for typical urothelial cancer However, some subtypes might grow or advance faster than typical urothelial cell cancer And faster growth might mean it needs more aggressive treatment Key points An important thing about bladder cancer is whether it has or it hasn\u2019t grown into the muscle layer Cancer that has invaded the muscle needs more aggressive treatment The stage of cancer describes how deep it has grown into the bladder wall and how far it

specialist Having HIV should not affect your cancer treatment The treatment options described in this guide apply to both HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients Imaging Imaging helps determine the extent of the cancer The size and spread of the cancer is used to guide treatment Computed tomography You may have a computed tomography (CT) scan of your chest, abdomen, and/or pelvis A CT scan is a more detailed kind of x-ray It takes many pictures of an area inside the body from different angles A computer combines the pictures to make three-dimensional (3-D) images During the scan, you will lie face up on a table that moves through a large tunnel-like machine To see everything better, a substance called contrast may be injected into your vein and also mixed with a liquid you drink Contrast makes the CT pictures clearer The contrast may cause you to feel flushed or get hives You will be able to hear and talk to the technician at all times You may hear buzzing or clicking during the scan PET/CT A CT scan may be combined with another imaging test called positron emission tomography (PET) PET uses small amounts of radioactive materials called radiotracers About an hour before the scan, you will be injected with a sugar radiotracer The radiotracer gives off a small amount of energy that can be seen by the imaging machine Cancer appears brighter in the pictures because cancer cells use sugar more quickly than normal cells In some cases, PET may be performed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (described next) instead of CT MRI An MRI makes pictures of areas inside the body without using radiation An MRI can show the tissues of the uterus, cervix, and vagina in detail Magnetic resonance imaging MRI uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to make pictures of areas inside the body It is especially good at making clear pictures of areas of soft tissue Unlike a CT scan or -ray, MRI does not use radiation You may have an MRI of your pelvis An MRI can show the tissues of the uterus, cervix, and vagina closely An MRI may show whether the cancer has spread to tissues next to the cervix, such as the parametrium, vagina, bladder, or rectum For those with small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix (NECC), MRI of the brain is also recommended as part of initial testing Getting an MRI scan is similar to getting a CT scan You will lie face-up on a table that moves through a large tunnel in the scanning machine The scan may cause your body to feel a bit warm Like a CT scan, a contrast agent will be used to make the pictures clearer MRI scans take longer to complete than CT scans The full exam can take an hour or more Tell your doctor if you get nervous in tight spaces Transvaginal ultrasound If you cannot have MRI of your pelvis, you may have an ultrasound instead Ultrasound uses sound waves to make pictures of areas inside of the body It is good at showing the size, shape, and location of the cervix In a transvaginal ultrasound, a probe will be inserted into your vagina This helps your doctor see the cervix and nearby areas more clearly Transvaginal ultrasound Ultrasound uses sound waves to make pictures of the inside of the body For a transvaginal ultrasound, a probe is inserted into the vagina Ultrasounds are generally painless, but you may feel some discomfort when the probe is inserted Fertility and pregnancy If you want the

on the chest The breast is made of milk ducts, fat, nerves, lymph and blood vessels, ligaments, and other connective tissue Behind the breast is the pectoral (chest) muscle and ribs Muscle and ligaments help hold the breast in place Breast tissue contains glands that can make milk These milk glands are called lobules Lobules look like tiny clusters of grapes Small tubes called ducts connect the lobules to the nipple The ring of darker breast skin is called the areola The raised tip within the areola is called the nipple The nipple-areola complex (NAC) is a term that refers to both parts The breast The breast is a glandular organ made up of milk ducts, fat, nerves, blood and lymph vessels, ligaments, and other connective tissue Lymph fluid drains from breast tissue into lymph vessels and travels to lymph nodes near your armpit (axilla) Lymphatic fluid is a clear fluid that gives cells water and food It also helps to fight germs Nodes near the armpit are called axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) Ductal carcinoma in situ Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or intraductal carcinoma is found in the cells that line the ducts Ducts are thin tubes that carry milk in the breast DCIS is noninvasive cancer Noninvasive means the cancerous cells are in place (in situ) and have not spread anywhere else DCIS is a preinvasive disease DCIS is treated to prevent invasive breast cancer, a more advanced form of cancer Invasive breast cancer is breast cancer that has spread from the milk ducts or milk glands (lobules) into the surrounding breast tissue or nearby lymph nodes Once outside the ducts or lobules, breast cancer can spread through lymph or blood to lymph nodes or other parts of the body Anyone can develop breast cancer, including those assigned male at birth Although there

During a mammogram, the breast is pressed between two plates while you stand in different positions Multiple x-rays will be taken A computer combines the x-rays to make detailed pictures Screening mammograms are done on a regular basis when there are no signs or symptoms of breast cancer Results take a few days Diagnostic mammograms are used for those who have symptoms such as a lump, pain, nipple thickening or discharge, or whose breasts have changed shape or size Diagnostic mammograms are also used to take a closer look at an abnormal area found in a screening mammogram A radiologist will evaluate the diagnostic mammogram while you wait so if additional testing is needed, it can be done right away Both types of mammograms use low dose x-rays to examine the breast They may use either the standard 2-dimensional (2D) digital mammogram or 3-dimensional (3D) mammogram known as tomosynthesis. 2 Testing for DCIS Test results General health tests Physical exam Imaging tests Biopsy

lymphoma should be treated Two different organizations categorize FL based on grade In the 2022 World Health Organization classification (WHO5), follicular lymphoma grades 1, 2, and 3A are termed classic FL (cFL) International Consensus classification (ICC) groups grades 1 and 2 as cFL This book follows the ICC classification system. h FL grade 1 and 2 are treated as classic FL according to the ICC. h Grade 3A might be treated as classic FL or DLBCL depending on the cancer center and the types of cells found with testing FL grade 3B (FL3B) called follicular large B cell lymphoma in the WHO5 is rare It is treated as DLBCL Types of FL The following types of FL are described in this book Classic FL As mentioned on the previous page, classic FL (cFL) is grade 1 or Almost everyone with FL has a chromosome translocation or has excess levels of the BCL2 protein in their tumor A chromosome translocation is the switching of part of one chromosome with another chromosome within the lymphoma cells Uncommon FL When FL has uncommon pathologic (disease) features or is t(14;18)-negative, it might be called uncommon FL (uFL) It is treated as classic FL in this book Pediatric-type FL Pediatric-type FL (PTFL) usually occurs in children but can also occur in adults Usually, only one lymph node is enlarged in the head and neck region and there might be no symptoms Transformed FL FL can transform into a more aggressive lymphoma called diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) This means your slowgrowing FL has turned into a large-cell, fastgrowing lymphoma Transformed FL can occur before, during, or after treatment In DLBCL, tumors are commonly found in lymph nodes, spleen, liver, bone marrow, or other tissues and organs Key points The lymphatic or lymph system is a network of tissues and organs that helps your body fight infections and disease It is part of the immune system. h Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a cancer that develops from lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell Lymphocytes normally grow in response to infection or inflammation When they grow on their own without proper regulation, they can develop into lymphoma. h Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a slowgrowing (indolent) lymphoma that typically forms tumors in the lymph nodes However, FL can be found in other parts of the body In FL, excess amounts of abnormal B lymphocytes form clusters (follicles) in the germinal centers of lymph nodes Not everyone with FL needs treatment right away. 2 Testing for FL Test results General health tests Fertility (all genders) Preventing pregnancy

treat follicular lymphoma (FL) This chapter presents an overview of possible tests you might receive and what to expect Follicular lymphoma (FL) might be found because of swollen lymph nodes or an enlarged spleen Swollen lymph nodes can occur anywhere in the body but are most often in the neck, armpit, and groin area and in the chest, abdomen, and pelvis on imaging scans FL symptoms can include fever, night sweats, fatigue, and weight loss These symptoms are referred to as B symptoms Not everyone has the same symptoms Test results Accurate testing is needed to diagnose and treat FL Results

(ALL) is a fast-growing cancer that starts in lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell In ALL, bone marrow makes too many immature lymphocytes called lymphoblasts Lymphoblasts can crowd out other blood cells causing blood to not work as it should Treatment depends on the type of ALL, age at diagnosis, and other factors This book is for those being treated at an adult cancer center Blood Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a type of blood cancer Blood is a tissue A tissue is a group of cells that work together to perform a function Blood\u2019s function is to move oxygen and nutrients throughout the body and carry away waste Blood also plays an important role for the immune system and in preventing bleeding Blood cells Your blood contains different types of cells that float in plasma Plasma is a clear, yellowish fluid made up of mostly water More than half of your blood is plasma There are 3 types of blood cells: Red blood cells (erythrocytes) White blood cells (leukocytes), which include granulocytes, monocytes, lymphocytes, and others Platelets (thrombocytes) Blood cells have important jobs Red blood cells (RBCs) carry oxygen throughout the body White blood cells (WBCs) fight infections Platelets (PLTs) help control bleeding Blood stem cells Bone marrow contains stem cells A blood stem cell is an immature cell that can develop into a red blood cell, white blood cell, or platelet Blood cells are being replaced in your body all the time Many have a short lifespan Some white blood cells live less than one day Your body makes one million red blood cells every second How blood cells are formed Bone marrow is the sponge-like tissue in the center of most bones Inside your bone marrow are early blood-forming cells called blood (hematopoietic) stem cells All types of blood cells are created from blood stem cells At any given time, bone marrow will have cells in various stages of development, from very immature to almost fully mature This process is called differentiation After a blood stem cell develops into a red blood cell, white blood cell, or platelet, it is released in your bloodstream as needed Blood stem cells can copy themselves or \u201cselfrenew.\u201d These cells are rare The role of blood stem cells is to make cells that will become red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets These are called progenitor cells or precursor cells There are different types of progenitor cells: Lymphoid progenitor cells form into lymphoblasts that mature into lymphocytes Myeloid progenitor cells form into myeloblasts and other non-lymphoid blood cells ALL is thought to arise in lymphoid progenitor cells Blood cell formation All blood cells start as blood stem cells A blood stem cell has to mature or go through many stages to become a red blood cell, white blood cell, or platelet ALL affects the lymphoid progenitor cells, which develop into lymphocytes Copyright 2020 National Comprehensive Cancer Network\u00ae (NCCN\u00ae). www.nccn.org Lymphocytes A lymphocyte is a type of white blood cell found in blood and lymph tissue, as well as all organs in the body Lymph tissue includes lymph vessels and lymph nodes Lymphocytes help fight and prevent infection There are 3 main types of lymphocytes: B lymphocytes or B cells make antibodies An antibody is a protein T lymphocytes or T cells help fight infections, kill tumor cells, and control immune responses Natural killer (NK) cells can kill tumor cells or virus-infected cells ALL most often affects B cells or T cells Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a fastgrowing blood cancer that starts in diseasefighting lymphocytes of your immune system In ALL, bone marrow makes too many immature lymphocytes called lymphoblasts Lymphoblasts can crowd out other blood cells causing blood to not work as it should Acute leukemias grow faster than chronic leukemias In general, to be diagnosed with ALL, 20 percent or more lymphoblasts must be present in the bone marrow This means that at least 1 out of every 5 marrow cells are lymphoblasts In certain cases, a diagnosis of ALL is possible with less than lymphoblasts ALL

looks for changes only in the leukemia cells that have developed over time, and not changes in the rest of the body\u2019s cells It is sometimes called molecular testing, tumor profiling, gene expression profiling, or genomic testing Inside our cells are DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) molecules These molecules are tightly packaged into what is called a chromosome Chromosomes contain most of the genetic information in a cell Normal human cells contain 23 pairs of chromosomes for a total of 46 chromosomes Each chromosome contains thousands of genes Genes are coded instructions for the proteins your cells make A mutation is when something goes wrong in the genetic code Proteins are given names such as FLTGenes are identified in italics like this: FLT AML cells sometimes have changes in genes and chromosomes that can be seen under a microscope or found with various other tests Testing of your leukemia cells can gather specific information about your leukemia to help guide treatment AML genetic changes AML cells can have changes in genes and chromosomes Mutation testing looks for these changes or abnormalities that are unique to AML cells Examples of such changes are called deletion, insertion, inversion, amplification, translocation (rearrangement), and point mutation Amplification \u2013 When a part or whole chromosome or gene is increased (for example, duplicated) Deletion \u2013 When part of a chromosome or gene is missing such as del(5q) Insertion \u2013 When a new part of a chromosome or gene is included Inversion \u2013 Switching of parts within one chromosome such as inv(16) and inv(3) Point mutation \u2013 When part of a gene is changed Chromosome translocation and gene rearrangement \u2013 Switching of parts between 2 chromosomes When described at the chromosome level, it is called a translocation When described at the gene level, it is called rearrangement For example, the chromosome translocation is written as t(8;21)(q22;q1) and its gene rearrangement is written as RUNX1::RUNX1T Leukemia predisposition syndromes Some hereditary cancer syndromes can be passed down from biological parent to child A family history of leukemia can affect treatment A skin punch biopsy might be done if a predisposition condition is suspected If your blood was tested at diagnosis, you would see the genetic changes of the leukemia However, these may not be the genetic changes you were born with Therefore, a skin punch biopsy is used In this procedure, a small piece of skin and connective tissue is removed to get DNA that hasn\u2019t been altered by AML This will be used to see if you inherited genes that increase your risk of leukemia Leukemia predisposition syndrome can affect how your body responds to treatment Blood and saliva can be used when AML cells disappear (in remission) Biological family members who are possible hematopoietic cell donors might be tested for leukemia predisposition syndrome Testing of cells not affected by your leukemia (like skin) can help tell if you have a leukemia predisposition syndrome AML mutation testing Mutation testing using methods such as karyotype (or cytogenetics), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), next-generation sequencing (NGS), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) look for changes or abnormalities that are unique to AML cells (genes and chromosomes) A sample of your blood or bone marrow will be used to see if the AML cancer cells have any specific mutations Some mutations may determine the type of treatment given FISH Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a method that involves special dyes called probes that attach to pieces of DNA FISH can look for changes (abnormalities) that are too small to be seen with other methods It can only be used

show if the outer layer of the brain is swollen from leukemia (leukemic meningitis) An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan uses radio waves and powerful magnets to take pictures of the inside of the body It does not use x-rays, which means there is no radiation delivered to your body during the test Because of the very strong magnets used in the MRI machine, tell the technologist about any metal in your body Contrast may or may not be used A closed MRI has a capsule-like design where the magnet surrounds you The space is small and enclosed An open MRI has a magnetic top and bottom, which allows for an opening on each end Closed MRIs are more common than open MRIs, so if you have claustrophobia (a dread or fear of enclosed spaces), be sure to talk to your care team about it MRI scans take longer to perform than CT scans PET scan A PET (positron emission tomography) scan uses a radioactive drug called a tracer A tracer is a substance injected into a vein to see where cancer cells are in the body and how much sugar is being taken up by the cancer cells This gives an idea about how fast the cancer cells are growing Cancer cells show up as bright spots on PET scans However, not

ligaments, and other connective tissue Behind the breast is the pectoral (chest) muscle and ribs Muscle and ligaments help hold the breast in place Breast tissue contains glands that can make milk These milk glands are called lobules Lobules look like tiny clusters of grapes Small tubes called ducts connect the lobules to the nipple The ring of darker breast skin is called the areola The raised tip within the areola is called the nipple The nipple-areola complex (NAC) is a term that refers to both parts Lymph drains from breast tissue into lymph vessels and travels to lymph nodes near your armpit (axilla) Lymph is a clear fluid that gives cells water and food It also helps to fight germs Nodes near the armpit are called axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) The breast The breast is a glandular organ made up of milk ducts, fat, nerves, blood and lymph vessels, ligaments, and other connective tissue Breast cancer Breast cancer starts in the cells of the breast Almost all breast cancers are a subtype called carcinomas Carcinomas are cancers that start in the cells that line the inner or outer surfaces of the body There are different types of breast carcinoma, most of which arise in cells that make up the lining (epithelial cells) in the terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs) of the breast The most common types are either ductal or lobular Anyone can develop breast cancer, including those assigned male at birth Although there are some differences between those assigned male and those assigned female at birth, treatment is very similar for all genders How breast cancer spreads Cancer cells don\u2019t behave like normal cells Cancer cells differ from normal cells in the following ways Primary tumor Over time, cancer cells form a mass called a primary tumor Invasive Cancer cells can grow into surrounding tissues Invasive breast cancer is breast cancer that has spread from the milk ducts or milk glands (lobules) into the surrounding breast tissue or nearby lymph nodes Metastasis Unlike normal cells, cancer cells can spread and form tumors in other parts of the body called metastases In this process, cancer cells break away from the first (primary) tumor and travel through blood or lymph vessels to distant sites Once in other sites, cancer cells may form secondary tumors Since cancer cells can spread through the blood, it is still possible to develop metastases even when the axillary lymph nodes are negative for cancer Cancer that has spread to a nearby body part such as the axillary lymph nodes is called a local metastasis It might be referred to as locoregional disease or locally advanced Cancer that has spread to a body part far from the primary tumor is called a distant metastasis Breast cancer can metastasize almost anywhere but most commonly spreads to the bone (including spine), lungs, liver, brain, or distant lymph nodes Breast cancer that has metastasized to other parts of the body is still called breast cancer More information on invasive breast cancer is available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app Key points Anyone can develop breast cancer, but breast cancer occurs more frequently in persons assigned female at birth Inside breasts are lobules, ducts, fat, blood and lymph vessels, ligaments, and connective tissue Lobules are structures that make breast milk Ducts carry breast milk from the lobules to the nipple Breast cancer arises from epithelial cells (cells that make up the lining) in the terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs) of the breast and then spreads into surrounding tissue Invasive breast cancer has grown outside the ducts or lobules into surrounding tissue Once outside the ducts or lobules, breast cancer can spread through lymph or blood to lymph nodes or other parts of the body Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) has spread outside the breast and lymph nodes It is possible to have MBC when axillary lymph nodes do not have cancer. \u7701 Let us know what you think

(CT or CAT) scan uses x-rays and computer technology to take pictures of the inside of the body A CT scan takes many x-rays of the same body part from different angles All the images are combined to make one detailed picture A CT scan of your neck and chest may be one of the tests to look for cancer In most cases, contrast will be used MRI scan A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan uses radio waves and powerful magnets to take pictures of the inside of the body It does not use x-rays and there is no radiation exposure Because of the very strong magnets used in the MRI machine, tell the technologist if you have any metal in your body During the test, you will likely be asked to hold your breath for 10 to 20 seconds as the technician collects the images Contrast is often used A closed MRI has a capsule-like design where the magnet surrounds you An open MRI has a magnetic top and bottom, which allows for an opening on each end Closed MRIs are more common than open MRIs, so if you have claustrophobia (a dread or fear of enclosed spaces), be sure to talk to your care team about it Contrast material Contrast material is used to improve the pictures of the inside of the body Contrast materials are not dyes, but substances that help enhance and improve the images of several organs and structures in the body It is used to make the pictures clearer The contrast is not permanent and will leave the body in your urine immediately after the test The types of contrast vary and are different for CT and MRI Tell your care team if you have had allergic reactions to contrast in the past This is important You might be given medicines to avoid the effects of those allergies Contrast might not be used if you have a serious allergy or if your kidneys aren\u2019t working well PET scan A positron emission tomography (PET) scan uses a radioactive sugar-based substance called a tracer A tracer is injected into a vein to see where cancer cells are in the body and if they are using sugar produced by your body to grow Cancer cells show up as bright spots on PET scans However, not all tumors will appear on a PET scan Also, not all bright spots are cancer It is normal for the brain, heart, kidneys, and bladder to be bright on PET Inflammation or infection can also show up as a bright spot When a PET scan is combined with CT, it is called a PET/CT scan FDG-PET/CT An FDG-PET/CT uses a radiotracer called F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) It is made of fluoride and a simple form of sugar called glucose You cannot eat or drink for at least 4 hours before the scan This scan is most helpful when other imaging results are unclear It may help identify cancer in primary sites, lymph nodes, and/or distant sites If it clearly shows cancer in the bone, a bone scan and sodium fluoride PET/CT may not be needed FDG-PET/CT can be done at the same time as a CT used for diagnosis Ultrasound Ultrasound (US) uses high-energy sound waves to form pictures of the inside of the body This is similar to the sonogram used for pregnancy A wand-like probe (transducer) will be held and moved on your neck using gel Ultrasound is painless and does not use x-rays, so it can be repeated as needed Ultrasound is good at showing small areas of cancer that may be in lymph nodes Sometimes, an ultrasound or CT is used to guide a fine-needle biopsy (FNB) Keep these things in

your groin or pelvis Erectile dysfunction (difficulty getting an erection) or painful ejaculation What causes prostate cancer Many people who develop prostate cancer wonder where it came from and how they got it Cancer researchers don\u2019t know exactly what causes prostate cells to grow out of control (become cancerous) The fact is, everyone with a prostate has a risk of getting prostate cancer But several factors are linked to a higher risk of prostate cancer These are called risk factors A risk factor is anything that increases your chance of getting cancer Risk factors don\u2019t necessarily cause prostate cancer, but people with prostate cancer usually have one or more of these risk factors: Age The biggest risk factor for prostate cancer is age Prostate cancer is diagnosed most often in those aged 65 years and above Your chances of getting prostate cancer increase as you become older Family history Your family health history is information about the diseases and health conditions in your family A family history reflects a pattern of certain diseases among family members Where does the prostate fit in The prostate is a gland located in the pelvis\u2014the area between your hips The prostate is important for sexual reproduction Prostate: A gland in the male reproductive system A gland is an organ that makes fluids or chemicals the body needs The prostate gland makes a fluid that nourishes and helps transmit sperm The prostate also contains muscles that help propel semen through the urethra during ejaculation Semen: A fluid made up of liquids from the prostate and the seminal vesicles as well as sperm from the testicles During ejaculation, semen is released from the body through the urethra and out through the penis Urethra: A tube that carries urine from the bladder and out of the body The prostate surrounds the urethra just beneath the bladder Seminal vesicles: Two glands that make and store another part of the fluid that becomes semen The seminal vesicles are located above the prostate and behind the bladder Bladder: An organ that holds urine Having a close family member with prostate cancer (a sibling or parent) increases the chance of getting it yourself Those with a family history of certain other cancers (breast, ovarian, colon, pancreatic, and other cancers) may also be at higher risk for prostate cancer Genetic factors When cancer \u201cruns in the family,\u201d genetic testing can be done to find specific genetic changes (mutations) known to be linked with prostate cancer and other cancers For instance, having an inherited genetic change in the BRCA2 gene increases the risk of getting prostate cancer There are also genetic abnormalities that don\u2019t run in families and aren\u2019t inherited Race In the United States, Black males are more likely than white males to develop prostate cancer Prostate cancer in Black males is also more likely to occur at an earlier age and be more aggressive and more advanced when diagnosed Black males are also twice as likely to die from prostate cancer compared to white males Hispanic and Asian males are less likely than both white and Black males to be diagnosed with prostate cancer Several things contribute to these differences, such as barriers to accessing health care (including early detection screening), as well as biological and genetic factors, and other causes Researchers are trying to understand the reasons for these differences and what can be done to improve outcomes What does aggressive mean When health care professionals describe cancer as aggressive, they mean the cancer is likely to grow or spread more rapidly than average Aggressive can also be used to describe therapy that may be stronger or more intense than other treatment options Black males may want to talk with their health care providers about getting screening tests earlier and perhaps more often than what\u2019s recommended for other males Diet and lifestyle No one particular diet has been found to cause prostate cancer or to prevent it However, eating food that\u2019s high in fat, such as meat and dairy products, has been linked with an

won\u2019t cause prostate cancer to spread or worsen Genetic tests A genetic test is used to find harmful changes in your genes Genes are small segments of DNA inside every cell Genes provide the instructions to tell the cell how to make proteins, which carry out a lot of important functions in the body Once in a while, a gene will have or develop a change, called a mutation, that damages its function As a result of this mutation, the gene isn\u2019t able to make a normal protein so the protein can\u2019t do its necessary job This can affect the usual activities of the cell, which can lead to disease, such as cancer Mutations can be passed down in families, in which case they occur in every cell in your body Or mutations can occur spontaneously in just some of your cells In other words, they may be in your body before you\u2019re born (called a hereditary or germline mutation) or occur by Biopsy of the metastasis Prostate cancer may metastasize to lymph nodes, bones, or internal organs A biopsy of a metastasis (as seen here, taken from the liver) uses a hollow needle to remove a small core of tissue The tissue is tested in a lab to look for cancer cells. chance or environmental factors later in life (called an acquired or somatic mutation) The two basic types of genetic tests used for prostate cancer care are hereditary gene testing and tumor testing: Hereditary gene testing Sometimes, mutations in genes inherited from your parents can increase the risk of different cancers You can pass these genes on to your children Your siblings or other family members might also carry these mutations If you have a family history of cancer, your health care provider might suggest genetic testing to find out if you have an inherited cancer risk This is also called germline testing The goal of this type of genetic testing is to look for inherited (germline) mutations that occur in every cell in your body Genetic germline testing is done using a sample of your blood, urine, or saliva For prostate cancer, this testing typically looks for characteristic changes in these genes: BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, CHEK2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PALB2, PMS2, and others Having a hereditary mutation doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll automatically get cancer It means your chances for developing certain cancers is higher Some mutations can put you at risk for more than one type of cancer Inherited mutations in genes like BRCA1 or BRCA2 are also related to breast cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, and skin cancer (melanoma) Inherited mutations in MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, and PMS2 are related to colorectal cancer, uterine cancer, and other cancers in addition to prostate cancer If an inherited cancer risk gene is suspected based on your family\u2019s or your own health history, you should ask about genetic testing Your health care provider can talk to you about testing or refer you to a genetic counselor A genetic counselor is an expert who has special training in genetic diseases A genetic counselor can help you decide whether you would like to undergo germline testing and also help you interpret the results of these tests Inherited gene testing is recommended if you have prostate cancer and any of the following: Family members or relatives who have or had prostate cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, intestinal cancer, and certain other cancers Family history of mutations in certain genes including BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, CHEK2, and others Very-high-risk, high-risk, regional (cancer in a lymph node), or metastatic prostate cancer regardless of family history h Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry Talk to your medical providers and/or a genetic counselor about your family history of cancer Tumor testing Tumor testing (also called somatic testing, molecular tumor testing, or tumor profiling) requires a tissue sample from the tumor itself or from a metastasis in a lymph node, bone, liver, lung, or other affected area Or it may come a sample of your blood, which contains the tumor\u2019s DNA In this type of testing, the sample is analyzed to look at its molecular components Tumors often release molecules that can be used as clues for finding and

be emptied into a toilet without taking off the bag Neobladder For this procedure, the bladder is replaced with a segment of small intestine that acts like a new bladder (neobladder) Like the original bladder, this substitute bladder is attached to the ureters at one end and to the urethra at the other end This means that urine follows the same path out of the body it normally would if you still had your bladder Because urine leaves the body in the usual way, a stoma and an ostomy bag aren\u2019t needed A neobladder doesn\u2019t work exactly the same way as a real bladder You\u2019ll probably need to empty it more often at first, maybe every 1 to 3 hours Also, urine might come out when you don\u2019t want or expect it to, like during sleep This is called urinary incontinence With time and training, you\u2019ll be able to better control the flow of urine from your neobladder Even so, a neobladder may be difficult to empty completely Some people have a catheter inserted through their urethra to help empty the neobladder Continent cutaneous pouch (Indiana pouch) This urinary diversion uses a portion of the large intestine to create a pouch to hold urine. (It\u2019s also called an Indiana pouch because it was developed by surgeons at Indiana University.) A section of the small intestine is used to connect the pouch to a stoma in the wall of the abdomen A one-way valve, made from part of the intestine, prevents the urine from flowing out of the stoma The stoma can be covered by a small bandage Sometimes the stoma can be made in the belly button, making it much less noticeable A catheter must be inserted into the stoma, through the valve, and into the pouch several times a day to drain the urine A benefit to this type of urinary diversion is that no ostomy bag is needed This may appeal to people with concerns about body image or people who don\u2019t want to worry about the bag coming loose or leaking Intravesical therapy While surgery is done to remove visible cancer, intravesical therapy is used to destroy cancer cells that aren\u2019t visible or are hard to reach Intravesical therapy means putting medicine directly into the bladder It\u2019s done with a flexible tube, called a catheter, inserted into the urethra The medicine flows through the catheter and into the bladder using a process called instillation The two main intravesical therapies used to treat bladder cancer are bacillus CalmetteGu\u00e9rin (BCG) and chemotherapy Intravesical BCG Intravesical BCG therapy uses a fluid that contains a very weak bacterium (germ) The germ triggers the immune system, causing the immune system to attack cancer cells inside the bladder Intravesical BCG can lower the chance of recurrence (cancer coming back) or getting worse (invading bladder muscle) Intravesical BCG is commonly used for highgrade bladder cancer that hasn\u2019t invaded the muscle layer It\u2019s usually started about 3 to 6 weeks after TURBT, to allow the bladder time to heal It\u2019s given once a week for 6 weeks You should have a full re-evaluation at 12 weeks after starting treatment To prevent recurrence, you might be asked to continue having intravesical BCG therapy This is called maintenance therapy Maintenance therapy involves three intravesical BCG treatments (given in one week) at 3 months and again at 6 months after TURBT You may continue to have maintenance therapy every 6 months for up to 3 years, depending on the risk of recurrence Possible side effects of intravesical BCG therapy include fever, chills, the urge to Intravesical therapy Intravesical therapy is a treatment where a liquid medicine is placed directly into the bladder The medicine aims to destroy any cancer cells that TURBT left behind and to prevent any new cancer cells from forming. urinate, pain or difficulty when urinating, and blood or

treatment options are available in addition to treatment in clinical trials Ask your provider or another member of your care team about these potential options Intravesical chemotherapy Chemotherapy

diagnosed to determine the extent of your cancer or to see if it has metastasized PET imaging can also show how well treatment is working A PET scan requires injecting a radioactive substance called a tracer into your bloodstream It takes about an hour for the tracer to circulate throughout your body The tracer targets your cancer cells, which show up as bright spots on the scan Afterward, the

imaging is a special kind of PET imaging that locates a protein called prostatespecific membrane antigen (PSMA) on the surface of prostate cancer cells Prostate cancer cells make a lot of PSMA, so doctors developed tracers that target this specific protein PSMA/PET is especially useful for detecting cancer that has spread to nearby lymph nodes or has metastasized to farther areas It\u2019s also used to monitor prostate cancer that may return after treatment (recurrence) So, someone with early-stage prostate cancer may not need PSMA/PET imaging when first diagnosed Your team will discuss

biopsy them to check for cancer cells If the lymph node biopsy shows cancer, sometimes many nodes might be removed in a more extensive surgery called a lymph node dissection The nodes are then looked at under a microscope for signs of cancer This type of surgery is more extensive than surgery on the skin and is usually done while you are under general anesthesia (in a deep sleep) Sentinel lymph node biopsy A sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to which cancer cells most likely spread from a primary tumor Sometimes, there is more than one sentinel lymph node A sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a surgery that removes tissue samples to examine sentinel nodes The lymph nodes will be checked for cancer cells by a pathologist in a lab Sometimes people can have an SLNB at the same time as surgery The results will be used to stage the cancer and plan treatment To locate the sentinel lymph node(s), your surgeon will inject a radioactive, blue-colored substance into your skin near the tumor The substance will drain into the sentinel lymph nodes Your surgeon will identify the sentinel lymph nodes using a device and remove them through a small cut in your skin This procedure is generally done under general anesthesia Wound healing after surgery After surgery, there are different ways a wound can heal Some wounds heal better without stitches A wound might be left open (rather than being stitched together) and left to heal by itself, filling in and closing up naturally This is called secondary intention healing It could mean you will need regular dressings to the area for up to 6 weeks, but the full time to heal depends on the size, depth, and area of the wound A linear closure is another common form of wound healing The surgeon will cut a small amount of extra skin to change the shape of the wound from a circle to a fusiform (an oval that looks like a football) to help the surgeon stitch the wound together in a line Other wounds may need skin grafts or other types of surgery (such as rearranging skin, known as \u201cflapping\u201d) to heal well and lessen scarring A skin graft is a patch of skin that is removed by surgery from one area of the body and transplanted (attached) to another area This may be done the same day or a few days after a PDEMA/Mohs procedure or standard surgical excision After surgery, your skin will continue healing for a period of between 6 to 10 weeks Scar treatment and aftercare for the skin around the wound will likely be recommended Radiation therapy Radiation therapy (RT) is a type of cancer treatment that uses beams of intense energy \u2013 from electrons (beams), photons (high-energy x-rays), or protons (charged particles) -- to kill cancer cells Radiation therapy usually involves 5 daily brief treatments per week over 3 to 7 weeks Radiation treatments should be given by a practicing radiation oncologist (a doctor who is an expert in radiation treatment) Types of radiation therapy There are two general types of radiation therapy that can be used to treat CSCC: external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and brachytherapy In EBRT, a beam of radiation is directed at the tumor from a machine The two most common types of external beam radiation for CSCC are electrons and photons Electrons are used to treat superficial tumors Photons are used to treat deeper, more invasive tumors In brachytherapy, a radiation source is placed close to or in direct contact with the tumor for a short period of time Uses for radiation therapy Radiation therapy is an option for people after resection (surgery) of their cancer, or for those who cannot or choose not to have surgery However, radiation therapy can be very effective for small tumors, and for tumors in areas such as the head and neck Radiation therapy should not be used in people who have certain genetic conditions that put them at higher risk of skin cancer caused by radiation, such as basal cell nevus syndrome or xeroderma pigmentosum It may also not be appropriate for some people who have connective tissue diseases, such as lupus or scleroderma The same area generally should not be treated with radiation more than

lymphoma diagnosed Can primary CNS lymphoma be cured What\u2019s next Key points Being diagnosed with a brain tumor can be frightening and overwhelming This book will help you make sense of all the information that\u2019s out there It will also describe your options for treatment Taken together, you\u2019ll have the confidence to make wellinformed decisions What is primary CNS lymphoma Primary central nervous system lymphoma is a rare and aggressive cancer that affects the central nervous system (CNS) Let\u2019s break it down word by word to understand it better: Primary \u2013 Primary means first When talking about cancer, primary refers to the place where cancer first started Primary CNS lymphoma starts in the central nervous system Central nervous system \u2013 The CNS is made up of the brain and spinal cord Primary CNS lymphoma occurs more often in the brain than in the spinal cord, but it can also involve the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and/or the eyes Lymphoma \u2013 Lymphoma is cancer that forms from lymphocytes Lymphocytes are white blood cells that fight infections Cancer is what happens when cells grow out of control So, a lymphoma is an abnormal overgrowth of lymphocytes Now let\u2019s put it all together: Primary CNS lymphoma is a cancer that begins when lymphocytes in the brain and spinal cord grow out of control Primary CNS lymphoma starts in lymphocytes in the immune system The immune system is your body\u2019s natural defense against infection and disease Having an impaired immune system may increase the risk of developing this cancer Primary CNS lymphoma can spread to other areas within the nervous system For example, it may spread from the brain to the eyes But it rarely spreads to other areas of the body However, a different kind of lymphoma\u2014called secondary CNS lymphoma\u2014starts in another part of the body but then spreads to the brain or spinal cord This book is only about primary CNS lymphoma What is the CNS The central nervous system (CNS) receives signals from your senses, processes information, and controls your body\u2019s responses The CNS includes: The brain, which controls functions of the body such as feeling, moving, thinking, and learning The eyes are connected directly to the brain and are also part of the CNS. h The spinal cord, which transmits messages between the brain and the body Because the CNS is so important, your body has parts that protect it These include: Meninges, which are membranes that cover your brain and spinal cord Cerebrospinal fluid, which is a liquid that surrounds your brain and spinal cord. h Bones including the skull that shields your brain and the vertebrae that surround your spinal cord What causes primary CNS lymphoma Every person diagnosed with cancer wants to know how they got it Although no one knows exactly what causes a lymphoma, we do know that lymphomas often start with a genetic abnormality (mutation) in certain lymphocytes This abnormality causes these lymphocytes to grow out of control (become cancerous) The abnormality occurs on its own It\u2019s not a mutation that occurs in other cells or organs in your body And it\u2019s not typically passed down in families (hereditary mutation) Although primary CNS lymphoma is rare, it could happen to almost anyone However, some people with certain risk factors have a greater chance Risk factors A risk factor is something that increases your chance of developing a disease For example, having a reduced immune system increases the risk of developing primary CNS lymphoma Risk factors don\u2019t necessarily cause a disease (and just because you have risk factors, it doesn\u2019t mean you'll definitely get the disease) But people with primary CNS lymphoma often have one or more of these risk factors: Having an immunodeficiency disorder, which is an illness that weakens the immune system\u2019s ability to fight infections and diseases Primary CNS lymphoma is frequently linked to HIV, the immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS Carrying the Epstein-Barr virus, which is the virus that causes mononucleosis (\u201cmono\u201d) and other illnesses Epstein-Barr is one of the most common viruses in humans Most people are infected with it After you\u2019re infected, the virus remains dormant (inactive or \u201csleeping\u201d) in your body for life Having an autoimmune disease, such as lupus, in which the immune system overreacts and attacks healthy tissues and organs Having an organ transplant, which requires medications that suppress the immune system

autoimmune disorders, such as Crohn\u2019s disease Smoking A history of anal sex A history of sexually transmitted infection (STI) Risk reduction Anal cancer starts as areas of abnormal cells, called lesions, in or near the anus These pre-cancerous lesions are known as anal dysplasia Identifying and treating anal dysplasia may prevent anal cancer Other names for anal dysplasia include: Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) (mild dysplasia) High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) (moderate or severe dysplasia) Anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) Stage 0 anal cancer The HPV vaccine A vaccine that protects against 9 different strains of HPV, including the highest-risk strains, is available While previously only recommended for routine use in adolescents and young adults, vaccination is now an option for adults aged 45 years and under However, it is most effective in younger people because they have likely never been exposed to HPV Also, while the vaccine can prevent new HPV infections, it does not treat existing HPV infections or HPV-related cancers Diagnosis and treatment planning The most common symptom of anal cancer is bleeding from the anus, also called rectal bleeding You may notice blood in your stool, on toilet paper, or in the water of the toilet bowl Anal itching is also common Some people have pain in the anal area or feel like there is a lump or mass near the anus These symptoms should not be ignored They may be commonly attributed to hemorrhoids Although they may be embarrassing to talk about, it is important to be evaluated by a health care professional Most commonly, people with these symptoms reach out to their primary care physician (PCP), gynecologist, or gastroenterologist This is an important first step However, because anal cancer is fairly rare, certain specialists are best qualified to evaluate you Such specialists include colorectal surgeons and health care providers trained to conduct a test called high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) HRA typically takes place after a digital rectal exam (DRE) is performed Digital rectal exam The digital rectal exam (DRE) is an important exam for diagnosis, staging, and follow-up There is nothing high-tech about a DRE Digit is another word for finger In a DRE, your doctor inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into your anus and rectum This finger exam can detect or assess growths or other abnormalities in the anal canal and nearby areas High-resolution anoscopy (HRA) HRA is a procedure that allows your health care provider to view and examine the anal canal with magnification After a numbing gel is applied to the anal area, a short, hollow tool (an anoscope) is inserted a few inches into the anus Next, a liquid called acetic acid is applied to the anal canal tissue A special magnifying glass called a colposcope is then used to closely examine the tissues of the anal canal The acetic acid makes abnormal cells appear differently when viewed with the colposcope If abnormal or suspicious areas are seen, a sample of tissue is removed and tested This is called a biopsy This biopsy sample may provide the diagnosis of anal cancer If a colposcope is not used for the procedure, it is simply called standard anoscopy HRA may be more effective than standard anoscopy at identifying anal cancer and anal dysplasia (fast-growing abnormal cells) No special preparations need to be taken ahead of HRA The procedure is brief (about 20 to 30 minutes), generally painless, and you can go home afterwards Some people have minor bleeding and discomfort for a few days following the procedure Sometimes HRA is done in the operating room under general anesthesia SISCCA Superficially invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SISCCA) is the earliest form of anal cancer These small lesions are often found accidentally They may be found during a biopsy, or during removal of growths thought to be non-cancerous Such growths may include genital warts, hemorrhoids, or anal skin tags These cancers are tiny (less than 7 mm wide, smaller than a pea) and not deep at all Treatment for SISCCA is evolving If the lesion is completely removed during surgery, further

and how much the cancer has spread) and expected treatment results, and is considered when making treatment decisions Cancers that are linked to HPV tend to respond better to treatment. p16 testing is different than HPV testing. p16 is used as a surrogate marker for HPV infection because p16 usually increases in cancer cells when HPV is present HPV Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a group of viruses that infect the cells on the surface of skin or on the moist surfaces or inner linings of some organs and body cavities, such as the cervix, vagina, vulva, penis, anus, mouth, and throat HPV infection usually clears on its own However, HPV infections can cause abnormal tissue growth (warts) and sometimes cancer Cancer caused by HPV is called HPV-related cancer HPV is the main cause of squamous cell carcinomas of the throat (oropharynx), particularly cancers of the tonsils and base of the tongue HPV type 16 is responsible for 9 out of 10 throat cancers The remaining cancers are caused by HPV18, 33, and HPV-positive throat cancer is a distinct disease with specific tumor features that can be targeted during treatment. p16 HPV16 is detected using a test to look for p is a protein that slows cell division It is produced by a gene located on chromosome 9 (shown as 9p3) Human cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes or 46 chromosomes in total Testing to look for the presence (expression) of p16 is called biomarker testing. p16 can be found in cancers such as throat, cervical, vulvar, melanoma, and esophageal When too much (overexpression) of p16 is found in throat cancer, it means that the

of fighting cancer need to be studied in people If found to be safe and effective in a clinical trial, a drug, device, or treatment approach may be approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Everyone with cancer should carefully consider all of the treatment options available for their cancer type, including standard treatments and clinical trials Talk to your doctor about whether a clinical trial may make sense for you Phases Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment Treatment trials are done in phases Phase I trials study the safety and side effects of an investigational drug or treatment approach They also look for early signs that the drug or approach is helpful Phase II trials study how well the drug or approach works against a specific type of cancer Phase III trials test the drug or approach against a standard treatment If the results are good, it may be approved by the FDA Phase IV trials study the long-term safety and benefits of an FDA-approved treatment Who can enroll Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called eligibility criteria The rules may be about age, cancer type and stage, treatment history, or general health These requirements ensure that participants are alike in specific ways and that the trial is as safe as possible for the participants Informed consent Clinical trials are managed by a group of experts called a research team The research team will review the study with you in detail, including its purpose and the risks and benefits of joining All of this information is also provided in an informed consent form Read the form carefully and ask questions before signing it Take time to discuss with family, friends, or others you trust Keep in mind that you can leave and seek treatment outside of the clinical trial at any time Start the conversation Don\u2019t wait for your doctor to bring up clinical trials Start the conversation and learn about all of your treatment options If you find a

CNS lymphoma should consider joining a clinical trial for treatment Steroids Corticosteroids (often just called steroids) can shrink lymphomas and decrease swelling in the brain This can rapidly reduce the signs and symptoms of the lymphoma However, steroids lose their effectiveness and cause side effects when given long-term So steroids are only given for a short period of time usually in newly diagnosed patients Importantly, steroid therapy shouldn\u2019t start until after you have a biopsy and get a diagnosis This is because steroids can change the appearance of lymphoma cells, making it difficult for the pathologist to reliably diagnose the disease Side effects of steroids Common side effects of steroids are feeling hungry, trouble sleeping, slow wound healing, upset stomach, mood changes, and swelling in the ankles, feet, and hands Steroids may also significantly increase blood sugar levels Most side effects of steroids go away after the drug is stopped Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a drug treatment that damages and destroys rapidly dividing cells throughout the body Because cancer cells divide and multiply rapidly, they\u2019re a good target for chemotherapy But chemotherapy harms healthy cells, too The damage to healthy cells can cause side effects Treatment may include a single chemotherapy drug or a combination of drugs A combination of drugs is sometimes chosen because the drugs work better when they\u2019re used together Most chemotherapy drugs for primary CNS lymphoma are given intravenously (IV) This means the medicine is slowly infused through a tube into a vein in your arm or another part of your body The medicine travels in the bloodstream to reach cells throughout the body Some chemotherapy drugs are taken by mouth as a tablet or capsule Chemotherapy is given in cycles One cycle involves a few treatment days followed by several days of rest Different chemotherapy drugs have different cycles Common cycles are 14, 21,

and can often be cured Squamous cell skin cancer is a common skin cancer, especially in fair-skinned people It is the second most common type of skin cancer, after basal cell carcinoma The third type\u2014melanoma\u2014is much less common than the other types but can be more aggressive Because they do not behave like melanoma, basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers are often referred to as nonmelanoma skin cancers or keratinocyte carcinomas Cancer that starts in a squamous cell is called a squamous cell carcinoma Squamous cells are found in the top layer of the skin They can also be found in other areas of the body, such as the lungs, thyroid, and esophagus These types are treated differently than cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma Squamous cell skin cancers often begin as scaly patches on the skin that can become solid and misshapen This cancer is also called cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) This patient guide is about squamous cell skin cancer only The terms \u201csquamous cell skin cancer\u201d and \u201cCSCC\u201d are used interchangeably throughout this guide Skin basics Your skin is the largest organ of the body Skin protects you from invaders (such as microbes), helps control body temperature, and allows the sensations of touch, heat, and cold Skin has 3 layers: Epidermis is the outermost (top) layer of skin that provides a waterproof barrier and creates skin color (melanin) Dermis contains connective tissue, hair follicles, and sweat glands Hypodermis (subcutis) is the deepest layer, made up of fat and connective tissue Skin cancers are often formed in the epidermis There are 3 main types of cells in the epidermis: Squamous cells: These cells are thin, flat cells that look like fish scales, and are found in the tissue that forms the surface of the skin Basal cells: These cells are found in the lower part of the epidermis, called the basal cell layer Basal cells constantly divide to form new cells to replace the squamous cells that wear off of the skin\u2019s surface As these cells move up in the epidermis, they get flatter, eventually becoming squamous cells Melanocytes: These cells are found in the top layer of skin Melanin is produced in the melanocytes Melanin is responsible for the color of our hair, skin, and eyes In addition to providing color, melanin also protects our skin from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays Risk factors A risk factor is something that increases the chances of getting a disease For example, smoking cigarettes is a risk factor for developing lung cancer The major risk factors for squamous cell skin cancer are described next Sunlight/outdoor tanning Most squamous cell skin cancers are caused by spending too much time in the sun over the course of many years, especially in people who sunburn easily People with light skin, hair, and eyes who have been in the sun very often throughout their lives are at the highest risk for squamous cell skin cancer People who work outdoors are also at higher risk Because longterm sun exposure can lead to squamous cell skin cancer, it is more common in people who have spent more years in the sun Sun exposure Most squamous cell skin cancers are caused by spending too much time in the sun over a long period of time, frequent tanning, and getting sunburns Indoor tanning Indoor tanning is a major risk factor for squamous cell skin cancer Using all types of indoor tanning machines (eg, booths, beds) increases the risk of getting any type of skin cancer Environmental toxins People who are often exposed to pollutants such as tobacco smoke, exhaust from cars or other vehicles, and arsenic (which can be found in soil, water, and air) can experience skin damage that can lead to squamous cell carcinoma Scars and chronic wounds CSCC can form in scars or chronic (nonhealing) wounds, such as ulcers (sores) and burns This is known as Marjolin\u2019s ulcer CSCC that starts in damaged, inflamed, or scarred skin is difficult to treat and more likely to come back after treatment Actinic keratoses An actinic keratosis is an area of scaly or rough skin caused by exposure to the sun over time that may become

Layers of the stomach wall The wall of the stomach is made up of 5 layers: mucosa, submucosa, muscle layer, subserosa, and serosa Stomach cancer Most stomach (gastric) cancers start in the cells that line the inside of the stomach and make mucus These are called adenocarcinomas Almost all stomach cancers are adenocarcinomas Adenocarcinomas of the stomach are the focus of this book There are 2 major types of stomach adenocarcinomas Intestinal \u2013 Cells of the intestinal type stick together and form tube- and glandshaped structures This type is more likely to have mutations that can be treated with targeted therapy Diffuse \u2013 Cells of the diffuse type don\u2019t stick together and appear scattered over a wide area that can't be easily seen on the surface This type is less common Treatment is based on the type of stomach cancer and the location of the tumor Esophageal cancer Tumors that start in the cardia of the stomach and cross over into the area between the esophagus and stomach (esophagogastric junction) are treated as esophageal cancers More information on esophageal cancer is available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app When

through the layers of the stomach wall Cancer can spread to nearby lymph nodes, veins, arteries, and organs such as the liver, pancreas, and spleen It might also grow into nearby lymphatic or blood vessels, and from there spread to nearby lymph nodes or to other parts of the body Stomach cancer can also grow inwards and form an ulcer or masses that can cause symptoms Stomach cancers tend to develop slowly over many years Before cancer develops, precancerous changes often occur in the inner lining (mucosa) of the stomach Since these early changes rarely cause symptoms, they often go undetected Those with stomach cancer can be grouped into 3 main categories, depending on how far the cancer has spread Early-stage stomach cancer has not grown beyond the first layer (mucosa) of the stomach wall The tumor is often small (2 centimeters or less) and is not in any lymph nodes Locoregional or locally advanced stomach cancer has invaded other layers of the stomach wall and/or spread to the lymph nodes or organs near the stomach Metastatic stomach cancer has spread to other parts of the body The most common metastatic sites are the liver, abdominal lining (peritoneum), and distant lymph nodes It may also spread to the lungs or bone Cancer in regional lymph nodes In locoregional or locally advanced stomach cancer, cancer may have spread to the lymph nodes near the stomach.

have a computed tomography (CT) scan or an MRI A CT scan is a procedure that uses a computer linked to an x-ray machine to make detailed pictures of areas inside the body The pictures are taken from different angles and are used to create 3-dimensional (3-D) views of tissues and organs An MRI is a procedure that uses radio waves, a powerful magnet, and a computer to make detailed pictures of areas inside the body For both a CT scan and an MRI, a liquid called a contrast dye may be injected into a vein to help your tissues and organs show up more clearly in the picture Using a contrast dye for both the CT scan and the MRI is preferred unless it is contraindicated, which means you have an allergy or condition that could result in a harmful reaction A positron emission tomography (PET) scan uses a radioactive drug called a tracer A tracer is injected into a vein (through an IV using a needle) The needle is most often inserted on the inside of your elbow The tracer travels through your blood and collects in organs and tissues This helps the radiologist see certain areas more clearly You may need to wait for the tracer to be absorbed by your body, which takes about 1 hour The tracer is attached to a substance that your cells and tissues use Cancer cells use the substance differently than non-cancer cells The radioactive part of the tracer lets your care team see how your cells are using the Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) A very common type of skin cancer Occurs more often in lighter-skinned people Is commonly found in areas of the body exposed to sun,

inside the pelvis Everyone with a prostate has a chance of getting prostate cancer It\u2019s usually not fatal, particularly early-stage prostate cancer This chapter gives an overview of this common cancer What is prostate cancer Prostate cancer is a disease where cells in the prostate gland grow out of control The prostate is a gland located just below the bladder in the pelvis, deep inside the area of your body between your hip bones The prostate is about the size of a ping-pong ball and is an important part of the male reproductive system Besides the prostate, the male reproductive system includes the penis, seminal vesicles, and testicles Cancer is what happens when something goes wrong with the natural cell process causing some cells to grow out of control Cancer cells don\u2019t behave like normal cells Cancer cells develop genetic changes (mutations) that allow them to multiply and make many more cancer cells The cancer cells crowd out and overpower normal cells This can end up harming the body Cancer cells survive much longer than normal cells do They can replace many normal cells and cause organs to stop working well Cancer cells can also spread outside the prostate to other areas of the body The prostate gland is an important part of the male reproductive system It\u2019s located in the pelvis just below the bladder and is about the size of a ping-pong ball What are the symptoms of prostate cancer A symptom is a feeling or problem that can indicate a disease or condition Prostate cancer often grows slowly and shows no symptoms for a long time But you don\u2019t have to have symptoms to have prostate cancer In fact, most patients who are diagnosed with early prostate cancer have no symptoms Symptoms are more common for those with advanced prostate cancer Symptoms, if they occur, can include: Blood in the urine or semen Burning or pain while urinating Unexplained weight loss Bone, hip, or back pain It\u2019s important to know that prostate cancer has many of the same symptoms as a condition called enlarged prostate (also called benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH) An enlarged prostate can push against the bladder and compress the urethra, which slows the flow of urine and can cause a feeling that you haven\u2019t fully emptied your bladder Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in American males, after skin cancer However, prostate cancer has one of the highest survival rates of any cancer when found early BPH is much more common than prostate cancer It\u2019s difficult to tell the difference between the two conditions based on symptoms alone Be sure to tell your health care providers if you have any of these symptoms: Urinating frequently, especially at night Weak or intermittent urine stream Trouble urinating or straining to urinate Trouble holding in urine Feeling like your bladder hasn\u2019t fully emptied Dull pain in your groin or pelvis Erectile dysfunction (difficulty getting an erection) or painful ejaculation Where does the prostate fit in The prostate is located deep inside the lower body It makes semen and is important for sexual reproduction Prostate: A gland in the male reproductive system A gland is an organ that makes fluids or chemicals the body needs The prostate gland makes a protein (prostate-specific antigen, or PSA) that nourishes and helps transmit semen The prostate also contains muscles that help propel semen through the urethra during ejaculation Semen: A fluid made up of liquids from the prostate and the seminal vesicles as well as sperm from the testicles During ejaculation, semen is released from the body through the urethra and out through the penis Urethra: A tube that carries urine from the bladder and out of the body The prostate wraps around the urethra just beneath the bladder Seminal vesicles: Two glands that make another part of the fluid that becomes semen The seminal vesicles are located above the prostate and behind the bladder Bladder: An organ that holds urine What causes prostate cancer Many people who develop prostate cancer wonder where it came from and how they got it Cancer researchers don\u2019t know exactly

everyone with primary CNS lymphoma can be cured, but all can be treated Treatment can slow down the lymphoma\u2019s growth, reduce symptoms, and prolong life The main treatments for primary CNS lymphoma include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, stem cell transplant, or a combination of these treatments Another recommended option is receiving treatment in a clinical trial A message to caregivers and loved ones This book is for you, too This book will help you understand this disease and the challenges it presents People with lymphoma in the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) commonly develop problems with brain function This can show itself in multiple ways, such as slower thinking, memory loss, difficulty moving or walking, trouble speaking, inability to do everyday activities, changes in behavior, losing one\u2019s sense of self, and other problems Helping a person with primary CNS lymphoma can be challenging and time-consuming You may be providing physical, mental, emotional, and hands-on support You may be taking the patient to appointments, helping to lessen side effects, and even assisting with treatment decisions Gather as much help as you can Start with the online resources listed in the back of this book. 2 Tests for primary CNS Tests for diagnosis Tests after diagnosis What\u2019s next Key points Different tests are needed to identify primary CNS lymphoma and to make a treatment plan The key to confirming the diagnosis is removing a small sample of the tumor tissue and testing it Many diseases have signs and symptoms similar to primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma, including neurological illnesses and other types of brain cancer So it\u2019s important to have tests to confirm your diagnosis If you're given a diagnosis of primary CNS lymphoma, you\u2019ll have more tests to find out how far the cancer extends within the central nervous system or if it has spread to another area of the body Tests are also used to help plan your treatment Tests for diagnosis If you haven\u2019t yet been diagnosed with primary CNS lymphoma, you\u2019ll first have a physical examination and some general assessments of your health These include a neurological exam and an evaluation of your level of activity After these, you\u2019ll have imaging scans and one or more biopsies Neurological exam This exam involves some simple tests to check your alertness, balance, coordination, reflexes, hearing, and other senses Your doctor may also perform an eye exam to look at the health of the nerves in the back of your eye Performance status Your care team will want to know how well you can do ordinary day-to-day activities\u2014like taking a walk, climbing stairs, cooking dinner, carrying laundry, or taking a bath or shower This evaluation is called performance status The more activities you can do, the better your performance status Your care team uses this evaluation to get a sense of the level of treatment you may be able to handle and whether you may be eligible for a clinical trial Imaging Imaging tests take pictures (images) of the insides of your body The images show areas in the body that might have cancer The images can reveal a lymphoma\u2019s location, size, and other features MRI Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most useful imaging technique for identifying primary CNS

Treatment should involve a team of digestive health experts with experience in chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, and imaging Everyone with anal cancer is encouraged to consider enrolling in a clinical trial for treatment if available Anal cancer most often starts in squamous cells lining the canal that leads from the skin surface into the rectum Cancer that forms in squamous cells is known as squamous cell carcinoma Squamous cells are found in the tissues that form the surface of the skin and in other areas of the body Most colorectal cancers, in contrast, start in glandular cells and are called adenocarcinomas This difference is important in determining treatment options Anal squamous cell carcinoma is the focus of this patient guide Other rare types not covered here include anal adenocarcinoma and anal melanoma NCCN Guidelines for Patients\u00ae are available on rectal cancer and melanoma The anus The anus is the opening through which feces (also called stool) exit the body It is located at the very end of the large intestine (bowel) The colon is the first and longest section of the large bowel The rectum is defined as the last several inches of the large bowel Stool is held in the rectum until it leaves the body through the anus The rectum and anus are located within the pelvis The pelvis is the area of the body between the hip bones, below the abdomen Other organs in the pelvis include The anus The anus is the opening through which stool exits the body Anal cancer starts in either the anal canal or the perianal region The anal canal connects the rectum and the anal opening The perianal region includes the anal opening and the skin directly surrounding it. the bladder, uterus, ovaries, vagina, and prostate gland Anal cancer starts in either the anal canal or the perianal region The anal canal connects the rectum and the anal opening It is about 1 and a half inches (4 centimeters) long The anal canal is surrounded by muscles (anal sphincters) that relax to allow stool to leave the body through the anus The perianal region includes the anal opening and the skin directly surrounding it In some cases, an anal tumor can involve both the anal canal and the perianal skin Risk factors A risk factor is something that increases the risk of developing a disease Some people with no known risk factors develop anal cancer And, some people with risk factors never get anal cancer Risk factors for anal cancer are described next Human papillomavirus infection The risk factor most strongly linked with anal cancer is long-term infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) HPV is a sexually transmitted virus HPV is extremely common It affects almost everyone who has ever been sexually active Most people are unaware that they are\u2013or ever were\u2013infected In most people, the immune system gets rid of (\u201cclears\u201d) HPV from the body In some people, however, the virus causes long-term cell changes that develop into cancer The progression to cancer often occurs decades after the initial infection Doctors are still learning why one person gets anal cancer and another does not Cancers caused by HPV include anal, cervical, head and neck, penile, vaginal, and vulvar cancers There are more than 100 types (called strains) of HPV Infection with some strains is more likely to lead to anal cancer and other related cancers High-risk forms of HPV include HPV16 and HPV-HPV infection can also cause abnormal skin growths, called warts, to form on the anus or genitals Other risk factors The health- and lifestyle-related factors listed below can also increase the risk of anal cancer Some of these factors lead to a higher risk because they weaken the immune system This can can make it harder for the body to clear HPV

radiation therapy Chemoradiation Brachytherapy Systemic therapy Clinical trials Key points In this chapter, the main treatments for cervical cancer are described Your treatment options will depend on the extent of the cancer and other factors Surgery Surgery is often the main treatment for earlystage cervical cancer The types of surgery that may be used are described below Removing only a portion of the cervix may be an option for the earliest stage of cervical cancer In most cases, however, the entire cervix must be removed While this can sometimes be performed through the vagina, an abdominal incision (cut) is usually needed When the surgery is performed through a traditional (big) incision through the abdomen, the approach is known as laparotomy Minimally invasive (also called laparoscopic) surgery involves making only a few small cuts into your body There is usually less pain and scarring compared to surgery that uses a larger cut through the abdomen The time it takes to recover is also usually shorter Cone biopsy Cone biopsy involves removing a cone-shaped section of the cervix that includes tissue from both the ectocervix and endocervix It is a recommended treatment option for some small cervical cancers See Part 2: Testing and staging for more information on cone biopsy Trachelectomy Trachelectomy is surgery to remove the cervix The upper part of the vagina and pelvic lymph nodes may also be removed Trachelectomy is a fertility-sparing surgery The uterus and ovaries are left intact, allowing for the possibility of natural pregnancy in the future In a simple trachelectomy, only the cervix is removed In a radical trachelectomy, about 2 centimeters (less than a half inch) of vaginal tissue is removed in addition to the cervix Both types can be performed either through the vagina or the abdomen Hysterectomy Hysterectomy is surgery to remove the uterus (including the cervix) The types of hysterectomy that may be used to treat cervical cancer are described below An extrafascial (simple) hysterectomy removes only the uterus (including the cervix) Extrafascial hysterectomy can be performed through the vagina, through the abdomen, or using a minimally invasive approach This type is most commonly used for stage IA1 cancer A modified radical hysterectomy removes the uterus (including the cervix), a portion of the connective tissue that holds the cervix in place, and about a half inch or less of the vagina Modified radical hysterectomy is performed through the abdomen A radical hysterectomy removes the uterus (including the cervix), much of the connective tissue that holds the cervix in place, and the top quarter or third of the vagina Radical hysterectomy is performed through the abdomen There are other differences between these

glands Adrenal glands produce hormones that affect your body in different ways This chapter reviews the basics of adrenal tumors Adrenal glands Your body has 2 adrenal glands They are located on top of each kidney Adrenal glands are small, yellow glands that are important to the body\u2019s endocrine system The endocrine system is made up of tissues and organs that produce hormones Hormones are chemical substances that are made in one part of the body and carried through the bloodstream to other parts of the body where they help control how organs or cells work Each adrenal gland has 2 main parts: Adrenal cortex \u2013 This is the outer part of the adrenal gland The adrenal cortex makes 3 main hormones: cortisol, aldosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) These hormones control metabolism, blood pressure, and body features (such as hair growth and body shape) Adrenal medulla \u2013 This is the inner part of the adrenal gland The medulla makes 3 hormones: epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine These hormones control the body\u2019s response to stress This includes the \u201cfight or flight\u201d surge of adrenaline Adrenal glands Adrenal glands are small, triangle-shaped glands found on the top of the kidneys These glands make hormones that help to regulate your immune system, response to stress, metabolism, and other functions AnatomyoftheAdrenalGland Adrenal tumors Adrenal tumors can occur in one or both adrenal glands Most adrenal gland tumors are benign (not cancer) Adrenal tumors often do not cause symptoms and are found through an imaging test such as a CT or MRI scan performed for another reason Adrenal tumors are categorized in the following ways: Benign (not cancer) adrenal tumors do not metastasize (spread) to other parts of the body This type of tumor is often found by chance through imaging tests done for an unrelated issue Functional adrenal tumors are usually benign, although some are capable of becoming cancerous and spreading Benign functional tumors can still produce hormones and may be found during tests for hormone-related symptoms Malignant adrenal tumors are cancerous tumors They are rare, with about 300 to 500 people being diagnosed each year Certain genetic conditions may increase the risk for these tumors. treatment An adenoma that produces too much of the hormone aldosterone is called an aldosteronoma Whereas, an adenoma that produces too much of the hormone cortisol (stress hormone) causes a condition called Cushing syndrome Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) \u2013 Although it is the most common type of adrenal gland cancer, it is very rare and affects approximately 1 to 2 people out of every 1 million Adrenocortical carcinoma begins in the adrenal cortex It can be a functioning or nonfunctioning tumor If the tumor is functioning, it may produce more than 1 hormone Neuroblastoma \u2013 This rare type of adrenal tumor is cancerous It affects children ages 5 and under, though it is most often found in infants Neuroblastoma can spread to other parts of the body, including the bones Pheochromocytoma \u2013 This type of tumor begins in the adrenal medulla and is characterized by symptoms of high blood pressure, headache, rapid heartbeat, and sweating Most pheochromocytomas are benign, but can be cancerous Adenoma \u2013 This is the most common type of adrenal gland tumor, also referred to as adrenocortical adenoma It is a noncancerous tumor that can be functioning or nonfunctioning If an adenoma is small and/or does not produce excessive hormones, and is not causing symptoms, it may not need Types Adrenal tumor categories are further broken down into types They include the following: Adrenocortical carcinoma Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is an adrenal cancer that starts in one or both of the adrenal glands It can occur at any age But it\u2019s most likely to affect children ages 5 and under, and adults in their 40s and 50s If caught early, adrenal cancer can be cured However, if the cancer has spread beyond the adrenal glands, cure becomes less likely Treatment can be used to delay progression or recurrence Signs and symptoms Half of those with

pelvic exenteration A surgeon can create an artificial vagina using muscle from another area of your body A muscle in the lower abdomen called the rectus abdominus is often used for vaginal reconstruction This procedure is sometimes referred to as muscle flap reconstruction If the bladder is removed An ileal (incontinent) conduit is one type of urinary diversion After the bladder is removed, your surgeon will create a new tube from a piece of intestine (ileum) This tube will allow your kidneys to drain Your urine will now exit the body through a small opening called a stoma A small disposable bag attached to the outside of your abdomen collects the urine This is called an ostomy bag or ostomy pouch The bag stays attached to your body with the help of an adhesive part called a \u201cwafer.\u201d The wafer sticks to the skin and acts as a watertight barrier Another way urine may be redirected after removing the bladder is a continent urinary diversion It is also referred to as an artificial bladder or \u201cIndiana pouch.\u201d This method uses a segment of intestine to create a pouch to hold urine The pouch has a channel for urine to pass through made from intestine that connects it to the wall of the abdomen A stoma is made in the abdominal wall at the location of the reservoir Sometimes the stoma can be made in the belly button, making it less noticeable To drain urine, a catheter is inserted into the reservoir several times a day A benefit to this type of urinary diversion is that an ostomy bag does not need to be worn on the outside of the body If the rectum is removed If the rectum is removed, a permanent colostomy may be created A colostomy connects the remaining colon to the outside of the abdomen Stool exits the body through a stoma and goes into a bag attached to the skin In some cases, the remaining colon can be connected to the remaining rectum or anus and a permanent colostomy may not be required You may retain near-normal bowel function If the anus is removed during the surgery, a permanent colostomy is always needed If both the bowel and bladder are removed If both urinary and fecal diversion are needed, a double-barreled wet colostomy (DBWC) is sometimes used In this technique, only one opening (stoma) on the surface of the abdomen is needed Urine and stool are kept separate until they exit the body through the same stoma Compared to having separate urinary and fecal diversions, DBWC has been found to have other benefits, such as fewer leaks Metastatic cancer If left untreated, or if not diagnosed early, cervical cancer often spreads to the liver, lungs, and/or bone Cervical cancer that has spread to these organs is metastatic Cancer that had already metastasized when it was found is

across part of your bare chest A picture of your beating heart will be seen on a screen The pictures will be recorded for future viewing An echocardiogram shows the structure (valves and muscle thickness) and function of your heart (or ejection fraction) Ejection fraction is the amount of blood pumped out of the left side of your heart every time it beats If the amount of blood pumping from the left side of the heart is lower than normal, this indicates decreased heart function. 66 It is important to understand what you are going through If your doctor says something you do not understand, let them know 'I don\u2019t fully understand what this means' or 'I don\u2019t fully understand what you just said Can you please explain it in simpler terms?' This is an important way of advocating for yourself.\" Lumbar puncture Leukemia can travel to the fluid that surrounds the spine or brain This may cause symptoms such as headaches, neck pain, and sensitivity to light A test may be needed to know if leukemia cells are in your spinal fluid A lumbar puncture (LP) is a procedure that removes spinal fluid by inserting a needle into the middle of the lower back It is also called a spinal tap Key points In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), abnormal changes stop very immature white blood cells called myeloid blasts or myeloblasts from becoming mature blood cells As a result, there is a buildup of blasts in the bone marrow and blood making it hard for blood to do its work An aspirate or biopsy is the removal of a sample of tissue or group of cells for testing A diagnosis of AML is confirmed using a bone marrow aspirate and bone marrow biopsy In general, to be diagnosed with AML, 20 percent or more myeloblasts must be present in the bone marrow or blood This means that at least 1 out of every 5 cells are blasts In certain cases, a diagnosis of AML is possible with any number of blasts, particularly if specific gene mutations or abnormal chromosomes are also present Genetic and biomarker tests are used to learn more about your subtype of AML, to target treatment, and to determine the likely course the cancer will take called a prognosis Questions to ask What subtype of AML do I have What does this mean in terms of prognosis and treatment options Is there a cancer center or hospital nearby that specializes in my subtype of AML What tests will I have How often will they be repeated? h Will my insurance pay for these tests Who will talk with me about the next steps When? 3 Types of treatment Care team Systemic therapy Chemotherapy Targeted therapy Clinical trials Hematopoietic cell transplant Supportive care Side effects Key points Questions to ask Treatment for all types of AML will be in phases The goal of treatment is to put the cancer in remission This chapter provides an overview of possible treatments and what to expect Together, you and your care team will choose a treatment plan that is best for your subtype of AML Results from blood tests, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, and imaging studies will be used to guide your treatment plan It is important to have regular talks with your care team about your goals for treatment and your treatment plan Care team Treating acute myeloid leukemia (AML) takes a team approach Treatment decisions should involve a multidisciplinary team (MDT)",

usually given instead Treatment with both external (EBRT) and internal (brachytherapy) is recommended Options for non\u2013fertility-sparing treatment are provided next according to stage EBRT or chemoradiation may be needed after surgery Stage 1A1 Stage 1A1 cancers are typically diagnosed by cone biopsy If cancer is found at the margins (edges) of the removed tissue and there is no LVSI, you may or may not have more treatment If you want the option of becoming pregnant in the future, the cancer can often be observed without treatment For those who do not want to preserve fertility, an extrafascial (simple) hysterectomy is usually recommended Surveillance will begin If cancer or pre-cancer is found in the cone biopsy margins and surgery is not possible, brachytherapy is recommended EBRT may be given in addition to brachytherapy If cancer or pre-cancer is found in the cone biopsy margins and surgery is possible, there are two possibilities Your doctor may recommend another cone biopsy to confirm that the cancer is actually stage 1AIf pre-cancer is found at the margins, either an extrafascial (simple) hysterectomy or a modified radical hysterectomy is recommended Lymph nodes in the pelvis may be removed during either type of hysterectomy For stage 1A1 cancers with LVSI, modified radical hysterectomy with lymph node evaluation is recommended Stage 1A2 and 1B1 Extrafascial hysterectomy with lymph node evaluation is recommended for low-risk stage 1B1 and 1A2 cancers These cancers must meet the following criteria for extrafascial hysterectomy to be considered: No LVSI No cancer found in cone biopsy margins The tumor is any grade squamous cell carcinoma or a low-grade adenocarcinoma The tumor is 2 cm or smaller and not very deep h No signs of cancer spread in the body For 1A2 and 1B1 cancers that do not meet the above criteria, radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymph node evaluation is recommended Lymph nodes in the abdomen (para-aortic nodes) may be removed in addition to pelvic lymph nodes Stage 1B2 and 2A1 Radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymph node evaluation is recommended for these stages Lymph nodes in the abdomen (para-aortic nodes) may be removed in addition to pelvic lymph nodes Stage 1B3 and 2A2 Stage 1B3 cancers are larger than 4 cm (about the size of a walnut) but do not extend beyond the cervix Stage 2A2 cancers are also larger than 4 cm and extend into the upper vagina These cancers may be treated as earlystage (with surgery) or as locally advanced (with chemoradiation and brachytherapy) At this time, treatment with chemoradiation is preferred See the next page for more information on this option If surgery is planned, radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection is recommended Lymph nodes in the abdomen (para-aortic nodes) may also be removed Treatment after surgery After surgery, the pathologic (surgical) stage of the cancer is determined by examining the removed tissue The following information applies to the stages below, as determined by surgery: Stage 1 Stage 2A If testing finds no cancer in tissue beyond the cervix or in lymph nodes removed during surgery, there are 2 options External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is recommended for cancers with risk factors Observation is recommended for cancers without risk factors Your doctor will consider the tumor size, whether there is LVSI, and other factors when determining if EBRT is a good choice for you If EBRT is planned, platinum chemotherapy may be given during the same time period This is called chemoradiation If cancer is found in any pelvic or paraaortic lymph nodes, or in any tissues outside the cervix, treatment with chemoradiation is recommended Vaginal brachytherapy may be given in addition to EBRT and platinum chemotherapy

your height and weight Listen to your lungs and heart Look in your eyes, ears, nose, and throat Feel and apply pressure to parts of your body to see if organs are of normal size, are soft or hard, or cause pain when touched. h Feel for enlarged lymph nodes in your neck, underarm, and groin Testing takes time It might take weeks for all your test results to come in Please wait to discuss the

like your liver and kidneys Some possible tests are described next The list starts with more common tests Complete blood count and differential A complete blood count (CBC) measures the levels of red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets (PLTs) in your blood A CBC is a key test that gives a picture of your overall health AML often causes low counts of healthy blood cells, but it can also present with a high number of abnormal, malignant (abnormal) white blood cells There are several types of white blood cells A differential counts the number of each type of white blood cell It also checks if the counts are in balance with each other This test may show a high number of blasts in the blood Your care team will pay particular attention to the following CBC measurements: Hemoglobin (Hgb) is a measurement of how much oxygen can move through blood and if a red blood cell transfusion might be needed Platelets (PLTs) are cells that make the clot, thus preventing or stopping the bleeding. h An absolute neutrophil count (ANC) measures cells that fight bacteria and protect us from infections Blasts or leukemia cells can sometimes be detected in the blood and usually are reported as a percentage of cells Comprehensive metabolic panel A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) measures substances in your blood It provides important information about how well your kidneys and liver are working, among other things Creatinine Creatinine is a waste produced in the muscles Every person generates a fixed amount of creatinine every day based on how much muscle they have It is filtered out of the blood by the kidneys The level of creatinine in the blood tells how well the kidneys are working Higher levels of creatinine mean the kidneys aren\u2019t working as

thyroid 6 Who is at risk? 7 Key points There are different types of thyroid cancer Most are curable with the right treatment When possible, surgery is recommended for most thyroid cancers The thyroid The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in the front of the neck It has 2 lobes, a right and a left A thin piece of tissue called the isthmus connects the lobes The thyroid makes hormones These substances are essential for the body to function properly They circulate in the blood and help regulate body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, weight, and metabolism (how fast food becomes fuel for your body) The two main hormones made by the thyroid are thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) Together, these are often referred to simply as \u201cthyroid hormone.\u201d The thyroid uses a mineral from your diet called iodine to produce these hormones Certain foods and iodized salt contain iodine There are four pea-sized glands on the back of the thyroid gland These parathyroid glands control the amount of calcium in your bloodstream Thyroid gland The thyroid is a butterflyshaped gland in the lower front part of the neck It makes hormones that control blood pressure, metabolism, and other body functions Thyroid nodules Thyroid nodules are small, often round areas of abnormal growth within the thyroid gland Most are not cancerous Very small nodules usually can't be seen or felt Your provider may be able to see or feel a large nodule while examining your lower neck Most thyroid nodules don't cause symptoms They are often found by imaging tests done for a different reason Symptoms of a larger nodule could include: A visible lump in the neck Neck pain Voice changes Trouble breathing Problems swallowing Who is at risk Those assigned female at birth are 3 times more likely to be diagnosed with a thyroid cancer compared to those assigned male at birth Compared to other cancers, thyroid cancer is often diagnosed earlier in adulthood It is the most common cancer in adults aged 18 to 33 years For more information on cancer in this group, see NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer at NCCN. org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app Anything that increases the chances of developing a disease is called a risk factor The most well-known risk factors for thyroid cancer are described next Most people with thyroid cancer have no known risk factors Radiation exposure Anyone who has had radiation treatment to the head or neck in the past (to treat a childhood cancer, for example) is at increased risk of thyroid cancer Contact with large amounts of radiation in the environment as a result of a catastrophic event also increases the risk of developing a thyroid cancer Family history Most thyroid cancers are sporadic, meaning there is no clear cause or risk factor Only a small number are hereditary, or the result of inherited gene mutations (changes) A personal or family history of thyroid cancer or a related syndrome may increase the risk of thyroid cancer Syndromes related to thyroid cancer include familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), Carney complex, Cowden syndrome, and multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) Cowden syndrome is also known as PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS) This inherited syndrome can cause follicular thyroid cancer, and other cancers and health problems Tell your provider if you have a personal or family history of breast, endometrial, or colorectal cancer Key points The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in the neck It makes hormones that help regulate metabolism and other body functions Thyroid cancers start as small, often round areas of abnormal growth called nodules Most don\u2019t cause symptoms and are benign Thyroid cancer is the most common cancer in adults aged 18 to 33 years The most well-known risk factors are radiation exposure and a family history of thyroid cancer. 2 Testing 9 TSH test 9 Ultrasound 10 Biopsy 11 Key points If a thyroid nodule is found or suspected, a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) blood test and an ultrasound of the thyroid and neck are needed Your doctor uses the results to decide whether a biopsy is

different types of cells that float in plasma Plasma is a clear, yellowish fluid made up of mostly water There are 3 types of blood cells: Red blood cells (RBCs or erythrocytes) carry oxygen throughout the body White blood cells (WBCs or leukocytes), which include granulocytes, monocytes, and lymphocytes, fight infections Platelets (PLTs or thrombocytes) help control bleeding Usually in ALL, there are too many abnormal white blood cells (lymphoblasts) How are blood cells formed Bone marrow is the sponge-like tissue in the center of most bones Inside your bone marrow are early blood-forming cells called blood (hematopoietic) stem cells All types of blood cells are created from blood stem cells At any given time, the bone marrow will have cells in various stages of development, from very immature to almost fully mature This process is called differentiation After a blood stem cell develops into a red blood cell, white blood cell, or platelet, it is released into your bloodstream as needed The role of blood stem cells is to make cells called intermediaries that will become red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets These intermediaries are called progenitor cells or precursor cells There are different types of progenitor cells: Lymphoid progenitor cells form into lymphoblasts that mature into lymphocytes Myeloid progenitor cells form into myeloblasts and other non-lymphoid blood cells ALL is thought to arise from stem cells that make an increased amount of lymphoid progenitor cells Blood cell formation All blood cells start as blood

Chapter 2: Testing for ALL provides an overview of tests your child might receive, how fertility might be impacted by treatment, and the role of genetic and biomarker mutation testing Chapter 3: Types of treatments gives a general overview of treatment Everyone with ALL will be treated with steroids and multiagent chemotherapy Other types of systemic therapy might be given Chapter 4: Supportive care discusses what is supportive care and possible side effects of treatment Chapter 5: BCR::ABL1-negative or BCR::ABL1-like B-ALL discusses treatment for the most common type of B-ALL A clinical trial is the preferred treatment for these types of B-ALL Chapter 6: BCR::ABL1-positive B-ALL treatment aims to stop the activity of the BCR::ABL protein caused by the BCR::ABL1 gene Treatment is usually an intensive combination of systemic therapies Chapter 7: T-ALL discusses a group of cancers that start in T-cell lymphocytes T-ALL is less common than B-ALL Treatment options include a clinical trial or chemotherapy Chapter 8: Infant ALL treatment is different than for other age groups Infants are those under 12 months of age Chapter 9: Other resources provides information on patient advocacy groups and where to get help What can you do to get the best care Advocate for your child and yourself You have an important role to play in their care In fact, you\u2019re more likely to get the care you want by asking questions and making shared decisions with the care team Consider seeking the opinion of an ALL specialist and treatment at an experienced children\u2019s (pediatric) leukemia center The NCCN Guidelines for Patients will help you understand cancer care With better understanding, you\u2019ll be more prepared to discuss care with your child's team and share your concerns Many people feel more satisfied when they play an active role in their care You may not know what to ask the care team That\u2019s common Each chapter in this book ends with an

days followed by several days of rest Different chemotherapy drugs have different cycles Common cycles are 14, 21, or 28 days long Having chemotherapy in cycles gives your body a chance to recover after receiving the treatment Intrathecal chemotherapy If cancer cells are found in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or if an MRI of the spine shows cancer, chemotherapy may be infused directly into the CSF in some cases This is known as intrathecal or intra-CSF chemotherapy Intrathecal chemotherapy may be used in select cases or as part of specific treatment program for primary CNS lymphoma Intraocular chemotherapy In rare cases, primary CNS lymphoma may occur in the eye In these situations, the chemotherapy may be infused into a vein or directly into the eye Possible side effects from intraocular chemotherapy include eye irritation, infection, inflammation, and cataracts Cataracts can be treated with a routine operation by an eye surgeon Side effects of chemotherapy Like other therapies, the side effects of chemotherapy depend on many factors These include the drug, the dose, and the person Chemotherapy, especially in high doses, may not be the right treatment for people who are frail or older These individuals may have a difficult time dealing with the harsh side effects The main chemotherapy drug used to treat primary CNS lymphoma is high-dose methotrexate Methotrexate is one of the most effective drugs for treating many kinds of cancers But when given in high doses, methotrexate may cause damage to the kidneys, liver, and other organs In severe cases, kidney failure is possible To reduce this risk, you\u2019ll have to stay at the hospital during methotrexate treatment and receive fluids through a vein in your arm You may also be given medicine to reduce the toxicity of methotrexate and to prevent severe problems in your kidneys and other organs Many cancer treatments, including chemotherapy, can lead to birth defects So avoid becoming pregnant or getting someone pregnant while on chemotherapy treatment Other side effects of chemotherapy include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mouth sores, loss of appetite, hair loss, low blood cell counts, What about side effects A side effect is an unhealthy or unpleasant physical or emotional condition caused by treatment Every treatment for primary CNS lymphoma can cause side effects Side effects depend on many factors, such as the drug, the amount taken, the length of treatment, and the person Each person has an individual response to a drug Some people have many side effects Others have few Some side effects can be very serious Others are not serious but are still unpleasant Most side effects appear shortly after treatment starts and stop after treatment Other side effects are long-term or may even appear years later Your treatment team will monitor your side effects during and after your treatment Ask your team for a complete list of common and rare side effects of each treatment If a side effect bothers you, let them know There may be ways to prevent or avoid some side effects and help you feel better. and feeling very tired or weak (fatigue) Additional side effects are also

Vomiting, available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app Radiation therapy Before effective chemotherapy became available to treat primary CNS lymphoma, radiation therapy was the most commonly used treatment It\u2019s still an option for treating primary CNS lymphoma in people who can\u2019t have chemotherapy in the first phase of treatment (induction) Another situation in which radiation is sometimes used is in the second phase of treatment (consolidation) to kill cancer cells left over after induction treatment Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays or other radiation to kill cancer cells Like x-rays used for imaging, you won\u2019t see or feel anything during treatment The total dose of radiation is usually divided into small doses given over several weeks By giving a little every day, the radiation damages the tumor while better preserving the healthy tissue The most commonly used radiation technique for primary CNS

treatment for thyroid cancer Surgery may involve removing the entire thyroid gland, or just the half that contains cancer Lobectomy A lobectomy removes the lobe of the thyroid that contains the cancerous nodule The tissue connecting the two lobes (the isthmus) is also removed While under general anesthesia, a small incision is made in the front of the neck to remove the cancerous lobe Lobectomy may be an option for some small and low-risk differentiated thyroid cancers Total thyroidectomy A total thyroidectomy removes the entire thyroid gland Lymph nodes near the thyroid are also removed if they are known or suspected to have cancer This is called a neck dissection While under general anesthesia, a small incision is made in the front of the neck to remove the gland Most people stay in the hospital overnight after surgery After being discharged, it is important to follow the instructions for at-home care Contact your care team about any new or worsening side effects Long-term side effects of removing the thyroid can include: Low levels of calcium in the blood (hypoparathyroidism) Damage to the nerves that control your voice and swallowing Thyroid hormone replacement therapy After a total thyroidectomy, medicine is used to replace the hormones no longer being supplied by the thyroid This is called thyroid hormone replacement therapy It is needed lifelong in all people after total thyroidectomy After a lobectomy, about 1 in 3 people need thyroid hormone therapy Levothyroxine (eg, Levoxyl; Synthroid) is the most commonly used thyroid hormone replacement therapy The goal for most people is to keep the level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in the low normal range For higher risk thyroid cancers, or if there are signs of recurrence, the TSH level is kept lower than the normal range (suppressed) This helps prevent thyroid cancer cells from growing or returning Suppression is an important part of cancer therapy for most differentiated thyroid cancers Levothyroxine is taken as a pill once a day It must be taken on an empty stomach, at least 30 mintutes prior to eating a meal If not, it won't be adequately absorbed into the blood Finding the right dose can take some trial and error If the dose isn't optimal, common side effects include: Anxiety Trouble sleeping Racing heart (with or without an abnormal heartbeat) Sweating Blood tests are used to check the TSH level on a regular basis during thyroid replacement therapy Your doctor can find the right dose of thyroid hormone for you by checking the TSH level and adjusting the dose as needed Too much levothyroxine can cause health problems, including: Weakened bones Heart rhythm problems Having too much thyroid hormone (thyrotoxicosis) Calcium and vitamin D Your provider may recommend taking calcium and vitamin D supplements to help strengthen your bones Treatment team Treating thyroid cancer takes a team of experts Your care team may include an endocrinologist, radiologist, nuclear medicine specialist, surgeon, radiation oncologist, and medical oncologist You and your team will decide on a treatment plan that is best for you This written course of action covers every phase of the treatment process Radioactive iodine Radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy uses a form of radioactive iodine (iodine-131) to selectively kill thyroid cancer cells that take up (\u201ceat\u201d) iodine The goal is to target only the thyroid cells in the neck (both cancer cells and any remaining normal thyroid cells) and elsewhere in the body while sparing healthy cells and tissues RAI therapy may be used in the following situations: To lower the chances that a high-risk cancer returns after treatment To treat thyroid cancer that has spread within the body Shortly after thyroidectomy for some lower-risk cancers, using lower-dose iodine-131 (also known as remnant ablation) RAI therapy is used after total thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid cancers that take up iodine It is generally only recommended for cancers at higher risk of coming back RAI isn\u2019t effective against medullary or anaplastic thyroid cancer How is it given RAI therapy comes in liquid or pill form and is taken by mouth You may be asked to eat a diet low in iodine for 1 to 2 weeks before starting this treatment You need a high level of TSH for RAI therapy

Radioactive iodine therapy Monitoring and follow-up care Recurrence Metastatic cancer Key points Papillary, follicular, and oncocytic carcinoma are known as differentiated thyroid cancers These cancers usually grow slowly and have good treatment outcomes Differentiated thyroid cancers are treated with surgery to remove all or part of the thyroid For many years, total thyroidectomy was the standard treatment for all thyroid cancers Today, it remains a treatment option for everyone with thyroid cancer However, newer research shows that lobectomy may be just as effective for treating small, low-risk cancers that haven't grown or spread beyond the thyroid A potential benefit of lobectomy is that thyroid hormone replacement therapy may not be needed Or, a lower dose may be needed Papillary thyroid cancer Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common of all the thyroid cancers The most common subtype is \u201cclassic type.\u201d Other subtypes that may grow and spread more quickly include: Follicular variant of papillary thyroid cancer Tall-cell/columnar cell Hobnail Diffuse sclerosing Is surgery always needed Some small papillary tumors (no bigger than a pea) may be safely monitored without surgery This approach is known as active surveillance The size of the cancer is monitored using ultrasound For active surveillance to be an option, there also can't be any nearby lymph nodes suspicious for cancer, and the tumor can't be in a high-risk location (such as the back of the thyroid, butting up against the trachea) Thyroidectomy or lobectomy If surgery is needed, either a total thyroidectomy or lobectomy is performed Some papillary cancers should always be treated with total thyroidectomy A total thyroidectomy is recommended for papillary cancers that have grown or spread beyond the thyroid\u2014whether into the neck, to nearby lymph nodes, or to distant areas Tumors larger than 4 centimeters (cm) (about the size of a walnut) and high-risk types of papillary cancer should also be treated with total thyroidectomy Lymph nodes near the thyroid that are known to have cancer are also removed during surgery There are other reasons your doctor may recommend a total thyroidectomy Factors such as whether the neck area was ever treated with radiation therapy will be considered If the cancer is small and noninvasive, lobectomy may be a treatment

many Where The spread (metastasis) to distant sites (M): Has the cancer spread to distant organs such as the lungs or liver Biomarker testing: Does the cancer have any genes or mutations that might suggest treatment Staging is based on a combination of information to reach a final numbered stage Often, not all information is available at the initial evaluation More information can be gathered as treatment begins Doctors may explain your cancer stage in different ways than described next Staging includes: Anatomic \u2013 based on extent of cancer as defined by tumor size (T), lymph node status (N), and distant metastasis (M) Prognostic \u2013 includes anatomic TNM The prognostic stage also includes the assumption that you are treated with the standard-of-care approaches Prognostic stages are divided into clinical and pathologic Cancer staging is often done twice, before and after surgery Staging after surgery provides more specific and accurate details about the size of the cancer and lymph node status Clinical stage Clinical stage (c) is the rating given before any treatment It is based on a physical exam, biopsy, and imaging tests An example might look like cN1 or cMIn mouth cancer, the clinical stage is based on imaging and biopsy results These tests are done before any treatment as part of an initial diagnosis Pathologic stage Pathologic stage (p) or surgical stage is

spread through blood and lymph to form tumors in other areas of the body This is called metastasis Squamous cell skin cancer does not metastasize often For this reason, there is not much research on the best way to treat metastatic squamous cell skin cancer A discussion between different cancer doctors is recommended to consider your treatment options If surgery and/or radiation therapy cannot

determine how far the disease has spread Testing could also include scans of your upper body, stomach, and pelvis to check for any metastatic disease (spread) to those areas The best way to treat regional CSCC is with surgery to remove the tumor and nearby lymph nodes Radiation therapy with or without systemic therapy is often given after surgery to kill leftover cancer cells If surgery is not possible or not recommended, radiation therapy, systemic therapy, or a combination of both may be options If radiation therapy is not expected to kill the cancer completely or may harm critical healthy organs, systemic therapy alone is recommended Although it is uncommon, squamous cell skin cancer can metastasize Metastatic CSCC that cannot be removed with surgery and/or radiation is treated with systemic therapy Systemic therapy options for metastatic CSCC include immunotherapy or a systemic therapy given in a clinical trial If you are not a candidate for either of these, your doctor may recommend platinum-based chemotherapy or targeted therapy. 5 When treatment is over Skin exams by your doctor Prevention for patients at high-risk Steps you can take Key points You\u2019ve finished

higher risk of getting other types of skin cancer This chapter explains how you can help prevent and detect future skin cancers Skin exams by your doctor After finishing treatment, getting regular skin exams to monitor for the return of squamous cell skin cancer is very important These followup exams should include a complete check of the skin on your entire body, as well as the lymph nodes closest to the cancer site You will be asked to undress and put on a paper gown or drape Undergarments can be worn during the exam The gown will be adjusted to allow your doctor to see different

Stomach cancer How stomach cancer spreads Key points The stomach is a large, hollow organ that secretes enzymes and acid to aid in the digestion of food It is part of the digestive system The digestive system takes in food, breaks it down, absorbs the nutrients, and removes waste from the body. intestine at a time, the stomach also serves as a temporary holding chamber The large intestine prepares unused food to be moved out of the body There is not much activity where the stomach connects to the esophagus and small intestine However, the main body of the stomach is very active during digestion The stomach The stomach is a muscular, hollow organ located between the esophagus and the small intestine It secretes enzymes and acid that convert what you eat and drink into a liquid called chyme When empty, your stomach is about 10 to 12 inches in size The stomach is part of the digestive system The digestive system takes in and breaks down food, absorbs nutrients, and removes waste from the body It includes organs like your liver, gallbladder, stomach, pancreas, and intestines The digestive or gastrointestinal (GI) tract is part of the digestive system It includes the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, colon, and rectum Food and drink enter the mouth and move through the esophagus into the stomach Stomach contractions along with enzymes and acid break down food into chyme From the stomach, chyme enters the small intestine where nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream Since only small amounts of chyme are released into the small The digestive system The digestive system takes in and breaks down food, absorbs nutrients, and removes waste from the body It includes organs like your liver, gallbladder, stomach, pancreas, and intestines Parts of the stomach The parts of the stomach include: Cardia \u2013 the opening where the esophagus connects to the stomach Fundus \u2013 the upper part of the stomach, which forms a bulge higher than the opening of the esophagus (farthest from the pylorus) It stores undigested food and gases released from digestion Body \u2013 the main part of the stomach Antrum \u2013 the lower portion of the stomach where food mixes with enzymes and acid Pylorus \u2013 connects the stomach to the first part of the small intestine (duodenum) The pylorus is a valve that opens and closes during digestion This allows partly digested food and other stomach contents to pass from the stomach to the small intestine The esophagus joins the stomach just below the diaphragm at the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) The diaphragm is the thin breathing muscle below the lungs and heart that separates the chest from the abdomen The EGJ might be referred to as the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) Parts of the stomach The parts of the stomach include the cardia, the fundus, the body, the antrum, and the pylorus The stomach is part of the digestive system Many lymph nodes can be found along the lesser and greater curvatures of the stomach Stomach wall The stomach is made up of several layers The inner and outer layers are membranes A membrane is a very thin layer that covers a surface In between these membranes are layers of muscle and connective tissue The wall of the stomach is made of 5 main layers Mucosa \u2013 Inner membrane that is in contact with food It consists of 3 layers: \u2022 Surface epithelium \u2013 A thin, moist layer of cells that forms the interior stomach lining Epithelium makes a sticky, thick liquid called mucus that protects the stomach. \u2022 Lamina propria \u2013 A type of connective tissue found under the epithelium membrane Within and supported by the lamina propria are stomach glands formed by cells that have the functions of producing enzymes, acid, mucus, and hormones. \u2022 Muscularis mucosae \u2013 A thin strip of muscle that separates the mucosa from the submucosa Submucosa \u2013 A layer of connective tissue, blood vessels, and nerve cells It also contains larger lymph vessels and channels Muscle \u2013 A type of soft tissue that helps move food through the stomach It is also called muscularis propria Subserosa \u2013 A layer of connective tissue that supports the serosa Serosa \u2013 An outer membrane that covers the stomach The serosa is also called the serous membrane This membrane allows the stomach to move smoothly against other

EBRT, a large machine aims radiation at the tumor area Radiation therapy can be given alone but is more often given with other bladder cancer treatments: Chemoradiation Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are often used together to treat bladder cancer When given together, they work better than they do alone This is called chemoradiation or chemoradiotherapy Like many cancer treatments, chemoradiation works better for certain people than for others Trimodal therapy Trimodal therapy refers to a combination of three treatments: TURBT to remove all visible cancer, followed by radiation and chemotherapy given together (chemoradiation) In certain people with bladder cancer, trimodal therapy can be used instead of bladder removal surgery (radical cystectomy) This is why trimodal therapy is referred to as a \"bladder preserving\" treatment Clinical trials Therapy may also be given as part of a clinical trial A clinical trial is a type of medical research study and a vital way

clinical trials Talk with your care team about whether a clinical trial may make sense for you Phases Most cancer clinical trials focus on treatment Treatment trials are done in phases Phase 1 trials study the dose, safety, and side effects of an investigational drug or treatment approach They also look for early signs that the drug or approach is helpful Phase 2 trials study how well the drug or approach works against a specific type of cancer Phase 3 trials test the drug or approach against a standard treatment If the results are good, it may be approved by the FDA Phase 4 trials study the long-term safety and benefit of an FDA-approved treatment Who can enroll Every clinical trial has rules for joining, called eligibility criteria The rules may be about age, cancer type and stage,

bladder wall and removes them Radical cystectomy is the most widely used surgery for muscle-invasive bladder cancer It involves removing the bladder, nearby lymph nodes, and other organs in the pelvis A urinary diversion is a surgical procedure included with a radical cystectomy Its purpose is to provide a new way for urine to leave the body Intravesical therapy is the use of cancer medicine placed directly into the bladder through a catheter The medicine is slowly put into the bladder using a process called instillation Chemotherapy is treatment with drugs to kill cancer cells Most chemotherapy drugs are liquids that are slowly injected into a vein (infusion) Chemotherapy affects cancer cells (and other cells) throughout the whole body All treatments for bladder cancer can cause side effects Ask your care team about ways to deal with the side effects of treatment What\u2019s your stage If you\u2019ve reached this page, then you\u2019ve probably been told the stage of your bladder cancer Turn to the correct chapter to find out about your treatment If your urologist or another provider told you your cancer stage, but you don\u2019t remember or you didn\u2019t understand, call the

\u2022 The bladder is a hollow organ in the lower pelvis Its main job is to store urine (pee) In adults, the bladder can hold up to 2 cups of urine. \u2022 Urine is made by the kidneys and flows down to the bladder through two tubes called ureters. \u2022 The bladder gets bigger as it fills with urine and gets smaller when you pee It\u2019s about the size of an orange when empty and the size of a grapefruit when full When you urinate, the muscles in the walls of the bladder contract This forces the urine out of the bladder and through a tube called the urethra, which streams it out of the body. \u2022 Together, these organs are called the urinary tract Bladder cancer happens when abnormal (cancer) cells develop genetic errors (mutations) that cause them to make many more cancer cells Cancer cells also avoid normal cell death As cancer cells increase, they crowd out and overwhelm normal cells Over time, the cancer cells may form a tumor in the bladder Sometimes the cells grow deeper and invade the bladder\u2019s muscle layer The cancer may even break through the bladder and spread to other parts of the body Is bladder cancer common Bladder cancer is one of the most common cancers in adults Most people who have bladder cancer are aged 55 years and over Bladder cancer is often found at an early stage when the cancer is highly treatable However, bladder cancer commonly comes back again even after treatment In many cases, bladder cancer comes back in a different place and sometimes more advanced than before That\u2019s why follow-up testing is so important People with bladder cancer need regular follow-up tests for many years to check if the cancer has returned The most common kind of bladder cancer starts in the urothelial cells, which are stretchy cells that line the inside of the bladder Urothelial cells also form the inner layer in the rest of the urinary tract, which includes the kidneys, the ureters, and the urethra Cancer of the urothelium can start in these areas instead of the bladder, although it\u2019s less common Other (non-urothelial) types of bladder cancer are much less common These include squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and small cell carcinoma How is bladder cancer found Bladder cancer is usually found when a person has symptoms A symptom is a problem or feeling that may signal a disease or condition The most common symptom of bladder cancer, and the one that usually appears first, is having blood in your urine (hematuria) How does blood get into urine Bladder tumors are likely to release a little blood, which mixes with the urine in your bladder The blood may turn your urine pink or bright red Or, if there isn\u2019t enough blood to be visible, your urine may look normal But your clinical team can still detect blood by looking at a sample of the urine under a microscope Blood in the urine can be caused by many other things besides bladder cancer The most common cause is an infection in the urinary tract So anyone with blood in their urine should see a health care provider to get their urine tested Other symptoms of bladder cancer include: Frequent urination Urgency to urinate Painful urination Back pain Not every person with bladder cancer will have all these symptoms Some people will have no symptoms A person with one or more of these symptoms should visit a doctor or other health care provider who can recommend different tests These tests are used to make a diagnosis.

banking stores semen for later use by freezing it in liquid nitrogen The medical term for this is semen cryopreservation Egg freezing Unfertilized eggs can be removed, frozen, and stored for later use This is called egg freezing or oocyte cryopreservation Ovarian tissue banking This method involves removing part or all of an ovary and freezing the part that contains the eggs The frozen tissue that contains the eggs can later be unfrozen and put back in the body For more information on fertility and family planning, see the NCCN Guidelines for Patients for Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer at

cancer in the body Having a general idea of the structure of the colon wall is helpful for understanding how colon cancer is staged The colon wall is made of layers of tissue Cancer starts in the innermost layer that comes in contact with food This layer is called the mucosa The next layer is the submucosa It is made of connective tissue and contains mucus glands, blood and lymph vessels, and nerves The submucosa is followed by a layer of muscle called the muscularis propria The outer, fourth layer is called serosa (or adventitia) If left untreated, cancer cells grow through the layers of the colon wall, towards the inside of the abdomen The cancer can then invade structures or organs outside of the colon. \u81ea Your care team will give you information on: How to prepare for surgery

bowel habits Bowel blocked by scar tissue Organs pushing through tissues or muscles weakened by surgery (hernia) Cancer cells can also break off from the colon tumor and travel through lymph or blood to nearby lymph nodes The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system is used to stage colon cancer In the AJCC system, the following key pieces of information about the cancer are used to give it a stage: T: How far the tumor has grown into or through the colon wall N: Whether any lymph nodes have cancer M: Whether the cancer has spread to areas or organs outside the colon (metastasized) The T, N, and M scores are combined to assign the cancer one of the following stages: 0, I (1), II (2), III (3), or IV (4) The stages are explained below Stage 0 There are abnormal cells on the innermost layer of the colon wall These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into deeper layers of the colon wall Stage 0 colon cancer is also called carcinoma in situ of the colon Stage 1 The cancer has grown into either the second or third layer of the colon wall There is no cancer in nearby lymph nodes or in areas outside the colon Stage 2 The cancer has grown into, or beyond, the fourth layer of the colon wall There is no cancer in nearby lymph nodes or in areas outside the colon Stage 3 The cancer has spread from the colon to nearby lymph nodes or there are tumor deposits Tumor deposits are small tumors in the fat around the colon Stage 4 The cancer has spread to areas outside the colon and nearby lymph nodes Colon cancer spreads most often to the liver

body If a concerning amount of cancer remains after surgery, treatment options may include: Another surgery RAI therapy Radiation therapy Systemic therapy Monitoring After treatment with 1 or more of the above, thyroid hormone replacement therapy with levothyroxine is started This keeps the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level low or normal After lobectomy After a lobectomy, everything that was removed or sampled (biopsied) during surgery is examined and tested If examination of the tumor, other tissue, or lymph nodes by a pathologist finds certain concerning or highrisk features, another

made by a gland in your body Your blood carries hormones throughout your body A receptor is a protein found inside or on the surface of a cell Substances such as hormones attach (bind) to these receptors This causes changes within the cell Hormones recognize and bind to specific hormone receptors When hormones attach to receptors on breast cancer cells, they can cause cancer to grow If found, these receptors may be targeted using endocrine therapy There are 2 types of hormone receptors: Estrogen \u2013 plays a role in breast development Progesterone \u2013 plays a role in menstrual cycle and pregnancy Hormone receptor (HR) testing should be done on any new tumors A biopsy sample will be used Hormone receptor-positive In hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, IHC finds estrogen and/or progesterone hormone receptors Most breast cancers are Estrogen receptor (ER) is stimulated by estrogen and provides survival and proliferation (rapid growth) signals Cancer cells deprived of estrogen or which have their ER signal blocked with treatment may stop growing or die Progesterone receptor (PR) binds progesterone and also provides survival and proliferation signals It is thought that PR expression also suggests the tumor is estrogen dependent. breast cancer is treated with endocrine therapy, which blocks estrogen receptor signaling Hormone receptor-negative Hormone receptor-negative (HR-) breast cancer cells do not have either estrogen or progesterone hormone receptors These cancers are sometimes simply called hormone negative HR- cancers often grow faster than cancers Both the estrogen and progesterone receptors need to be negative for the cancer to be considered HR- Estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells In breast cancer, testing finds estrogen hormone receptors in at least 1 out of every 100 cancer cells In ER-low\u2013positive invasive breast cancer, testing finds estrogen hormone receptors in 1 to 10 out of every 100 cancer cells Endocrine therapy might not be recommended for ER-low\u2013positive invasive breast cancer HER2 status Inflammatory breast cancers often produce greater than normal amounts of HERHuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a protein involved in normal cell growth It is found on the surface of all cells When amounts are high, it causes cells to grow and divide Some breast cancers have too many HER2 genes or receptors Too many HER2s is called HER2-positive You might hear it called HER2 overexpression or amplification There are 2 tests for HER2: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) measures receptors If the IHC score is , the cancer is If the score is 0 or 1, it is considered HER2- If the score is , further testing is needed In situ hybridization (ISH) counts the number of copies of the HER2 gene This test is done mainly when the IHC score is unclear HER2 testing should be done on all new tumors A tumor biopsy sample will be used You might have more than one HER2 test Immunohistochemistry Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a special staining process that involves adding a chemical marker to cells These cells are then studied using a microscope IHC can find estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors in breast cancer cells A pathologist will measure how many cells have estrogen and/ or progesterone receptors and the number of receptors inside each cell Biomarker testing A sample from a biopsy of your tumor may be tested to look for specific DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) mutations/alterations, protein levels, or other molecular features This information is used

look inside your urethra and bladder for any sign of cancer This procedure uses a cystoscope, a tube with a camera and a light at the end, which is inserted into the urethra and through to the bladder Cystoscopy may be done at your urologist\u2019s office, a hospital, or a clinic The procedure takes only a few minutes, doesn\u2019t require general anesthesia, and you can go home afterward During a cystoscopy You\u2019ll lie on your back on an exam table You may be positioned with your feet up and your knees apart After lubricating your urethra (and possibly numbing it with an anesthetic gel), your urologist will slowly insert the cystoscope into the opening of the urethra This opening is at the tip of the penis or just in front of the vagina This may be uncomfortable at first but it shouldn\u2019t be painful The cystoscope will move through the urethra and into the bladder The urologist will view a monitor that shows real-time images of the inside of the bladder If any areas appear suspicious, the urologist may use a small tool on the cystoscope to remove tiny tissue samples for testing (biopsy) If a biopsy can\u2019t be done during this visit, you might be scheduled for a separate procedure on another day In addition to biopsy samples, the urologist can completely remove very small cancer growths during the cystoscopy However, if a tumor is found, you\u2019ll need to have it removed in an operating room at a clinic or hospital This procedure is further explained in Chapter Cystoscopy A cystoscopy is an exam to look inside the urethra and bladder for any signs of cancer If anything looks suspicious, the urologist can use a small tool on the cystoscope to remove tiny tissue samples for testing (biopsy) A flexible cystoscope (upper left) is used for viewing and

parts of the urinary tract\u2014the ureters and inner kidneys A ureteroscopy is done only if something seems abnormal with the ureters or kidneys After a cystoscopy After the procedure, you may have one or more of these side effects: Bleeding from your urethra, which can appear bright pink in your urine or on toilet paper A burning sensation during urination Urinating more often for the next day

you\u2019ve been introduced to the various treatment options for primary CNS lymphoma, the first step toward treatment is to come up with the best possible treatment plan This plan involves a number of different health care providers Multidisciplinary care During the course of your diagnosis and treatment, you\u2019ll be cared for by numerous doctors, specialists, and allied health providers These may include a neuro-oncologist, neurosurgeon, radiation oncologist, medical oncologist, pathologist, ophthalmologist, nurses, primary care doctor, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, palliative care specialist, pain specialist, psychologist, social workers, nutritionist, and rehabilitation specialists like physical, occupational, and speech therapists When all these providers are working and communicating as a team to help you, it\u2019s called multidisciplinary care It\u2019s helpful to understand the role that each team member plays Keep a list of names and contact information for each member of your team This will make it easier for you and anyone involved in your care to know who to contact with questions or concerns Ask who will coordinate your care and what efforts can be made to schedule appointments together Your multidisciplinary care team should clearly discuss your care goals with you Removing or reducing the size of your lymphoma is one goal of your team But you and your team\u2019s other goals may include improving your overall well-being, maintaining your ability to do dayto-day activities, reducing pain, getting good nutrition, and lowering stress and anxiety Your multidisciplinary team will meet to discuss your treatment and which options are best for you The next chapter explains the phases of treatment and what your individual treatment plan may be Quality of life Quality of life refers to a person\u2019s overall enjoyment of life, including their sense of well-being and ability to participate in their usual activities Your quality of life should be the main priority that guides your treatment and care Successful treatment isn\u2019t just about reducing the cancer Other goals include minimizing cognitive problems, reducing pain, lowering anxiety and stress, carrying out regular activities, being with friends and family, and enjoying life as best as you can Your multidisciplinary team When all of your doctors, specialists, and allied health providers are working and communicating as a team to help you, it\u2019s called multidisciplinary care Be clear about your treatment goals when you talk with your multidisciplinary team Key points h A recommended treatment option for primary CNS lymphoma is participating in a clinical trial Other treatment options include corticosteroids, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and stem cell rescue Often, some of these therapies are combined to treat primary CNS lymphoma Chemotherapy is a drug treatment that damages and destroys rapidly dividing cells throughout the body The main chemotherapy drug used to treat primary CNS lymphoma is methotrexate Whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is the most commonly used radiation technique for primary CNS lymphoma Targeted therapy drugs attack specific parts of cancer cells to slow their growth and spread Immunotherapy uses your body\u2019s immune system to fight cancer The main immunotherapy drug for primary CNS lymphoma is rituximab High-dose chemotherapy and stem cell rescue uses your own blood-forming stem cells to jumpstart the bone marrow to make more

points The liver is a large organ located on the right side of the body under the rib cage The liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts work together to make, store, and secrete bile Bile is a fluid that helps digest fat in the food you eat The liver also filters your blood and makes other important substances called factors that help your body function normally This chapter will discuss the liver and give an overview of liver cancer The liver The liver is a large organ located on the right side of the body under the rib cage Inside the liver is a network of blood and lymph vessels The liver filters blood, helps with blood clotting, makes bile, breaks down fats, and helps process sugar for energy The liver also produces lymph Lymph gives cells water and food and contains white blood cells that fight germs The liver has two lobes, a right and left lobe Blood enters the liver from the hepatic artery and the portal vein Blood leaves the liver through the hepatic veins before entering the inferior vena cava and returning to the heart The gallbladder is located near the right side of the liver and close to the first part of the small intestines (duodenum) The liver and nearby organs The gallbladder, stomach, pancreas, spleen, and small intestine are found near the liver Bile Liver cells make bile Bile is a yellow or green fluid made up of cholesterol, bilirubin, salts such as potassium and sodium, water, and other elements found in the body It flows into small channels that drain into thin tubes called ducts These ducts form larger and larger channels that flow into the left and right hepatic ducts The left and right hepatic ducts join to form the common hepatic duct The common hepatic duct joins with the cystic duct that connects to the gallbladder to form the common bile duct The common bile duct is joined by the pancreatic duct just before it enters the small intestine The gallbladder The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ found under the liver It is sometimes described as sac-like because it holds bile from the liver Bile is stored in the gallbladder, and when you eat, it then passes through the bile ducts into the small intestine to help digest food The hepatobiliary system The liver is part of the hepatobiliary system. \u201cHepato\u201d means liver and \u201cbiliary\u201d refers to the gallbladder and bile ducts Together, they form the hepatobiliary system The hepatobiliary system makes bile and is a part of the digestive system The digestive system takes in food, breaks it down, absorbs nutrients, and removes waste from the body Some doctors consider the pancreas to be a part of this system Liver blood supply Blood enters the liver through the hepatic artery and portal vein Blood exits the liver through the hepatic vein Credit: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/ File:Diagramshowingthetwolobesoftheliver anditsbloodsupplyCRUKsvg Liver cancer Cancer that starts in the liver is called primary liver cancer Secondary liver cancer is when other cancer types spread to the liver For example, cancer can start in the intestines (colon) and spread to the liver This is called metastatic colon cancer to the liver There is more than one type of primary liver cancer in adults The most common type is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) There is a subtype of HCC called fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLHC) FLHC affects very few people and usually occurs at a younger age The second most common type of primary liver cancer in adults is called intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, which is a cancer of the bile ducts Other primary liver cancers in adults include rare types of sarcoma that start in the blood vessel cells of the liver Another rare type is made of both hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma This is called a mixed-type tumor More information on gallbladder and bile duct tumors is available at NCCN.org/ patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app In the following pages, this patient guideline will focus on the most common type of liver cancer, HCC, and its treatment How liver cancer spreads Liver cancer can spread in many ways It can spread directly through the liver It

other areas in the body. 2 Diagnosing kidney cancer Test results General health tests Blood tests Urine tests Imaging tests Biopsy Biomarker testing Genetic risk testing Performance status Key points Most kidney cancers are found by chance during imaging tests for other health problems Further testing is used to confirm (diagnose) kidney cancer This chapter presents an overview of possible tests you might receive and what to expect Test results Results from imaging studies and possible biopsy will be used to determine your treatment plan Treatment will be based on these findings It is important you understand what these tests mean Ask questions about your test results Don\u2019t hesitate to ask questions and take notes during appointments Write down questions and ask a friend or family member to take notes Caregivers should ask questions, too Organize your medical documents, including insurance forms, medical records, and test results Keep a list of contact information for your care team and update your primary care physician (PCP) regarding any changes Include details about the specific type of cancer, treatment, and dates in your contact list Keep these things in mind: It's beneficial to have a support system in place during diagnosis and treatment Enlist the help of friends, family members, or peers who can provide transportation, meals, and emotional support These can be different people for different tasks or change over time Consider bringing someone with you to doctor visits if possible or have someone on the phone or join you for telehealth visits Ask your care team how best to communicate with them, especially in an emergency For possible tests and procedures, see Guide", "extracted_entities": ["Kidney cancer", "lungs", "lymph nodes", "bones",

Overview How is bone formed TNM scores Numbered stages Key points Questions to ask Cancer staging is used to help make treatment decisions It describes the size and location of the tumor, and if cancer has spread to lymph nodes, organs, or other parts of the body This chapter provides a general overview of cancer staging Overview There are many staging systems Most staging systems include information about: Where the tumor is located in the body The size of the tumor Whether the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes Whether the cancer has spread to a different part of the body Tumor grade, which refers to how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope How is bone formed Bone is a living tissue made of cells (osteocytes, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts), calcium, phosphate, hydroxyapatite (a bone mineral), and collagen New bone formation, known as ossification, starts in the womb and ends during adolescence, between 10 and 19 years of age Ossification is complete when the skeleton is done growing Once ossification is complete, bone is continuously being replaced by a process called remodeling Remodeling breaks down and rebuilds bone and helps maintain normal calcium levels in the body When calcium is needed, cells called osteoclasts break down bone This releases calcium into the bloodstream At the same time, bone-forming cells called osteoblasts create bone from calcium in the bloodstream Some types of bone cancer can interrupt this process Parts of bone: Epiphysis \u2013 the end of the bone, which is covered with cartilage to make a joint Metaphysis \u2013 located between the physis (growth plate) and diaphysis Diaphysis \u2013 the middle region of the bone Physis \u2013 the growth plate, which is made of cartilage After skeletal maturity, this leaves a physeal scar or line visible in the bone TNM scores The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system is used to stage most bone cancers In this system, the letters T, N, and M describe different areas of cancer growth Based on imaging and biopsy results, your doctor will assign a score or number to each letter The higher the number, the larger the tumor or the more the cancer has spread to lymph nodes or other organs These scores will be combined to assign the cancer a stage A TNM example might look like this: T1N0M0 or T1, N0, MThis might represent a stage 1 cancer. h T (tumor) \u2013 Size and depth of the main (primary) tumor N (node) \u2013 If cancer has spread to nearby (regional) lymph nodes M (metastasis) \u2013 If cancer has spread (metastasized) to distant parts of the body Cancer staging is often done twice Clinical stage (c) is the rating given before any treatment It is based on a physical exam, biopsy, and other tests Pathologic stage (p) or surgical stage is determined by examining tissue removed during surgery such as in the removal of a lymph node Pathologic features include size, shape, and type of cell The spine The spinal or vertebral column includes a flexible column of bones called vertebrae The spine includes the sacrum and tailbone (coccyx) There are 24 bones in the flexible spine: 7 cervical (neck), 12 thoracic (upper back), and 5 lumbar (lower back) T Tumor The primary (main) tumor size is measured in centimeters (cm) A large pea is 1 cm A golf ball is 4 cm A baseball is 7 cm A grapefruit is Tumors in limbs, torso, skull, and face Tumors are staged based on location The appendicular skeleton is composed of 126 bones of the upper limbs, the lower limbs, the shoulder girdle, and the pelvic girdle The

muscle The cancer grade is also important when determining if local excision is an option The cancer grade is a rating of how fast the cancer is expected to grow and spread It is based on how abnormal the cancer cells look when viewed under a microscope Higher scores mean that the cancer is likely to grow and spread quickly There are 5 possible grades: GX: Grade cannot be assessed (undetermined grade) G1: Well differentiated (low grade) G2: Moderately differentiated (intermediate grade) G3: Poorly differentiated (high grade) G4: Undifferentiated (high grade) Local excision should only be considered for low-grade (G1) and intermediate-grade (G2) perianal cancers The normal tissue surrounding the lesion removed during surgery is called the surgical margin If a margin of at least 1 cm is removed and it does not contain cancer cells, no further treatment is needed The cancer will be observed See Follow-up and surveillance on page 22 for next steps If a margin of less than 1 cm is removed or if the tissue contains cancer cells, more treatment is needed The preferred next treatment is another surgery (re-excision) Another option is radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy If this treatment option is planned, chemotherapy regimens that may be used with radiation include: Mitomycin and capecitabine Mitomycin and 5-FU 5-FU and cisplatin Next steps See Follow-up and surveillance on page 22 for next steps Chemoradiation Chemoradiation is recommended for all nonmetastatic perianal cancers that do not meet the criteria for local excision This includes: Fast-growing

treatment information Next steps See Follow-up and surveillance on page 22 for next steps Follow-up and surveillance After finishing treatment for anal cancer, you will have testing to find early signs that cancer may have returned This is called surveillance Surveillance for the return of anal canal cancer and perianal cancer is the same A follow-up physical exam with digital rectal examination (DRE) and anoscopy is recommended 8 to 12 weeks after completing chemoradiation to check the results of treatment Your doctor may also order imaging tests Depending on the results, the cancer is assigned to 1 of the following categories: Complete remission \u2013 there are no signs of cancer in the body Persistent disease \u2013 cancer remains in the body but has not grown or spread Progressive disease \u2013 the cancer has grown or spread Complete remission If initial follow-up testing finds no signs of cancer, recommended surveillance going forward is described below Digital rectal exams DREs are recommended every 3 to 6 months for 5 years after treatment Lymph node exams Inguinal lymph node exams are recommended every 3 to 6 months for 5 years after treatment Anoscopy Where possible, anoscopy is recommended every 6 to 12 months for 3 years after treatment In some patients, after treatment with radiation therapy, anoscopy may not be possible due to discomfort or pain In this case, you and your doctor may decide together to omit it or perform it less often than every 6 to 12 months Imaging For stage II and III anal cancers in complete remission after treatment, surveillance also includes imaging Imaging is recommended every year for 3 years You should have a CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast, or a CT of the chest without contrast and an MRI of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast Other care In addition to surveillance testing, a range of other care is important for anal cancer survivors See Part 3: Survivorship for more information If cancer returns during surveillance, see Recurrence on page Persistent disease If cancer is found during initial follow-up examination, it does not mean that treatment failed Some anal cancers take longer to respond to treatment than others It may be safe to monitor the cancer for as long as 6 months after treatment to see if there is improvement Waiting to see if the cancer improves may avoid the need for surgery to remove the anus If the cancer does not go into complete remission or gets worse, see \u201cProgressive disease\u201d below If the cancer goes into remission,

agree on should be noted in the treatment plan, along with possible side effects Keep in mind that your plan may change Testing may provide new information Your feelings about treatment may change Side effects or other health conditions may prompt a change of plan Key points The ovaries are a pair of grapesized organs in the pelvis They make hormones and eggs for sexual reproduction Most ovarian cancers affect the layer of tissue surrounding the ovaries, called the epithelium High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) and high-grade endometrioid carcinoma are the most common types of ovarian tumors Less common ovarian cancers can start in the epithelium, in tissues that support the ovaries, or in the reproductive (egg) cells of the ovary Treating ovarian cancer takes a team of experts Gynecologic oncologists and medical oncologists often work together to plan your treatment. 2 Testing for ovarian cancer Abdominal and pelvic exam Imaging tests Biopsy Family history and genetic testing Nutritional and digestive tract health Blood tests Biomarker testing Key points This chapter describes the testing used to learn more about suspected ovarian cancer, including whether surgery is possible Ovarian cancer can cause changes in the body that you can feel or notice But you might not have symptoms until the tumor has grown large or the cancer has spread Common symptoms include: Feeling bloated Heartburn and indigestion Pain or pressure in the pelvis or belly Trouble eating or feeling full fast Having to urinate often or urgently Pain during sex These symptoms can also be caused by hormonal changes or other common health problems Ovarian cancer is more likely to be the cause if the symptoms: h Began less than 1 year ago, h Occur more than 12 days per month, and Are becoming more severe over time If your provider suspects ovarian cancer based on your symptoms, you will have testing as described in this chapter Testing helps determine the clinical (pre-treatment) stage The clinical stage provides a best guess of how far the cancer has spread It is a best guess because surgery is needed in order to know exactly how much cancer is in the body Testing also helps determine whether surgery first is the best treatment Having surgery first may not be possible based on the size and location of the tumor, or because of other health factors Abdominal and pelvic exam Your provider will feel different areas of your belly This is called an abdominal exam They are checking to see if organs are of normal size, are soft or hard, or cause pain when touched Your doctor will also feel for signs of fluid buildup (ascites) in the belly area or around the ovaries Your provider will also feel for abnormal changes in the size, shape, or position of your ovaries, cervix, and uterus This is called a pelvic exam A widening instrument, called a speculum, is used to view your vagina and cervix A sample of cells may be removed for testing This is known as a Pap test It is used to detect cervical cancer or pre-cancer, not ovarian cancer Sometimes, a biopsy of the uterine lining (an endometrial biopsy) may be part of the initial evaluation during the pelvic exam This test can rule out a uterine cancer An exam of the rectum and vagina together may also be done to check for cancer in the space between the rectum and vagina This is called a rectovaginal exam Imaging tests Imaging tests can show the location, size, and shape of an ovarian tumor They can also show if the cancer has spread beyond the ovaries Your care team will tell you how to prepare for your imaging tests Ultrasound Ultrasound is often the first imaging test used to look for ovarian cancer It uses sound waves to make pictures of areas inside of the body Ultrasound is good at showing the size, shape, and location of the ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, and nearby tissues It can also show if there is a mass in the ovary and whether the mass is solid or filled with fluid The 2 types of

Staging Cancer care plan Key points Your doctors will make a treatment plan just for you First, they will need to gather information about the cancer and your general health This chapter describes testing and other care needed to create your treatment plan Biopsy Cervical biopsy and pathologic review A cervical biopsy involves removing small samples of tissue from the cervix It is the most commonly used procedure to diagnose cervical cancer Samples may be taken from the rounded, bottom part of the cervix (ectocervix) and/or from the endocervical canal The removed tissue is examined by a specialized doctor called a pathologist A pathologist is a doctor who specializes in evaluating cells and tissues to diagnose disease The pathologist looks for abnormal areas, including areas of cancer or pre-cancer The pathologist also determines the type of cervical cancer, when possible Cone biopsy Cone biopsy can be both a test and a treatment It may be used to gather more information about the extent of the cancer after a cervical biopsy It is also a recommended treatment option for some early cervical cancers Also known as cervical conization, cone biopsy involves removing a cone-shaped portion of the cervix The cone-shaped sample includes tissue from both the ectocervix and the endocervical canal All of the transformation zone\u2014where the ectocervix and endocervix meet\u2014is removed Most cervical cancers start in this area Most commonly, a technique called cold knife conization (CKC) is used In this method a surgical scalpel is used to remove the tissue In some cases loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) may be performed instead In LEEP, a thin loop of electrified (heated) wire is used instead of a scalpel to cut out the cervical tissue After removing the cone-shaped sample of tissue, your doctor may use a spoon-shaped tool called a curette to scrape a sample of tissue from the cervical canal This is called endocervical curettage The tissue removed during a cone biopsy is examined under a microscope by a pathologist Cone biopsy A cone biopsy removes a coneshaped section of the cervix that includes the transformation zone Cone biopsy may be the only treatment needed for some earlystage cervical cancers Health history and physical exam To help plan treatment, expect your doctor to ask about your past and current health, including: Illnesses, diseases, and surgeries Medicines that you take (prescription or over-the-counter) Your lifestyle (your diet, activity level, whether you smoke or drink alcohol) Possible symptoms of cervical cancer, such as watery vaginal discharge Your doctor will also do a physical exam of your body, which may include: Checking your vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate, and body temperature) and overall appearance Feeling and/or listening to the organs in your abdomen, including your liver and stomach h A pelvic examination to check the size, position, and appearance of your cervix and uterus It is important to let your doctor know if you have trouble with pelvic exams due to pain, anxiety, or other reasons Blood tests The following blood tests may be ordered as part of initial testing They can provide helpful information about your general health and the health of your liver, kidneys, and other organs before treatment A complete blood count (CBC) is a common test that measures the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in a sample of blood Red blood cells carry oxygen throughout the body White blood cells fight infection Platelets help to control bleeding A blood chemistry profile measures the levels of different chemicals in your blood Chemicals in your blood are affected by your kidneys, bones, and other organs and tissues Blood chemistry levels that are too high or too low may be a sign that an organ is not working well Abnormal levels may also be caused by the spread of cancer or by other diseases Liver function tests are often done along with a blood chemistry profile The liver is an organ that does many important jobs, such as remove toxins from the blood Liver function tests measure enzymes that are made or processed by the liver Levels that are too high or too low may be a sign of liver damage or cancer spread", "extracted_entities": ["Cervical Cancer", "adenocarcinoma", "Adenosquamous

prostate cancer This chapter describes the available treatment options and what you might expect from them Talk with your care team about which treatment could be best for you Prostate cancer is a complex disease with many treatment options Treatments for advanced-stage prostate cancer include hormone therapy as well as non-hormone therapies like chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and radiation therapy Often, hormone therapy is combined with one or more other therapies Combining therapies can be more effective than using either therapy alone. key word in ADT is \u201cdeprivation\u201d\u2014this therapy \u201cdeprives\u201d (starves) the cancer of its main fuel: androgens This can shrink the tumor or slow tumor growth for a while You might hear the term \u201ccastration\u201d used when describing prostate cancer or its treatment This term describes a drastic reduction of testosterone Castration can be done with hormone-lowering medication or by surgical removal of one or both testicles (orchiectomy) Though orchiectomy is a surgical procedure, it\u2019s still considered hormone therapy because it removes the primary source of testosterone: the testicles While drug hormone therapy can be reversed when the medication is stopped, orchiectomy is permanent and can\u2019t be reversed Surgical removal of the testicles is much less common these days because systemic Hormone therapy Hormone therapy is a systemic (whole-body) treatment that adds, blocks, or removes hormones A hormone is a natural chemical made by a gland in the body Its job is to activate cells or organs Male hormones are called androgens The main androgen is testosterone Most of the testosterone in the body is made by the testicles Testosterone helps produce sperm, among other functions But testosterone also helps prostate cancer grow A type of hormone therapy called androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) can stop your body from making testosterone or block cancer cells from using testosterone The What is ADT Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) brings testosterone down to a very low level ADT treatments include: LHRH agonist (goserelin, leuprolide or triptorelin) LHRH agonist anti-androgen (nilutamide, flutamide, or bicalutamide) LHRH antagonist (degarelix or relugolix) Surgical castration hormone therapy is often just as effective at blocking testosterone Hormone therapies for prostate cancer include luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists and LHRH antagonists, both of which cause the testicles to stop making testosterone You may have heard of leuprolide (Lupron), a commonly used LHRH agonist or degarelix (Firmagon), a commonly used LHRH antagonist Most LHRH agonists and LHRH antagonists are injections These may be given monthly, or 2, 3, or 4 times a year The exception is relugolix (Orgovyx), an LHRH antagonist that comes as a tablet taken once a day Anti-androgens, corticosteroids, and androgen synthesis inhibitors are also available as pills and taken 1 to 3 times a day, depending on the medication See Guide Newer hormone therapies Hormone therapy has been the main treatment for advanced prostate cancer for several decades

visits may be done by a nurse practitioner or physician assistant Oncology nurses provide your hands-on care, like giving systemic therapy, managing your care, answering questions, and helping you cope with side effects Oncology pharmacists are experts in knowing how to use medicines to treat cancer and to manage symptoms and side effects Palliative care nurses, advanced practice providers (APPs), and physicians help provide an extra layer of support with cancer-related care Radiation therapists provide your hands-on delivery of radiotherapy treatments Nutritionists and dietitians can provide guidance on what foods are most suitable for your condition Psychologists and psychiatrists are mental health experts who can help manage issues such as depression, anxiety, or other mental health conditions that can affect how you think and feel Social workers help people solve and cope with problems in their everyday lives Clinical social workers also diagnose and treat mental, behavioral, and emotional issues The anxiety a person feels when diagnosed with cancer might be managed by a social worker in some cancer centers They, or other designated professionals, can help navigate the complexities of financial and insurance stresses A research team helps to collect research data and coordinate care if you are in a clinical trial Clinical trials help bring new therapies to patients and advance the treatment for everyone Consider asking your care team about access to clinical trials Your physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing are important Help other team members

systemic, or usually a combination of both Local therapy focuses on the breast, chest wall, and lymph node area It includes: Mastectomy (surgery) Radiation therapy Systemic therapy works throughout the body It includes: Chemotherapy HER2-targeted therapy Inhibitors Immunotherapy Endocrine therapy For a list of systemic therapies, see Guide IBC is treated with systemic therapy to shrink the tumor, followed by surgery to remove the breast and lymph nodes, and then radiation therapy Surgery is not always possible Even though surgery might not be an option, systemic therapy will continue Systemic treatment is based on estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 expression It is important to have regular talks with your care team about your goals for treatment and your treatment plan There are many treatment options However, not everyone will respond to treatment in the same way Some people will do better than expected Others will do worse Many factors play a role

in the rectum can be cured, especially when found and treated early This guide describes treatment for adenocarcinoma, the most common type of rectal tumor The rectum The rectum is the last several inches of the large intestine (bowel) After digested food becomes stool in the colon, it is held in the rectum until it exits the body through the anus The rectal wall is made of layers of tissue Cancer starts in the innermost layer that comes in contact with stool If left untreated, cancer cells grow through the layers of the rectal wall, towards the inside of the pelvis The cancer can then invade structures or organs outside of the rectum Cancer cells can also break off from the rectal tumor They can travel through lymph or blood to nearby lymph nodes or to distant organs like the liver or the lungs The term colorectal cancer is used to describe cancers that form in either the colon or rectum While these cancers are similar, their treatment is different The focus of this guide is rectal cancer For information on colon cancer treatment, see the NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Colon Cancer at NCCN.org/ patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app The rectum The rectum is about 5 inches (12 centimeters) long and forms the last part of the large bowel Stool is held in the rectum until it leaves the body through the anus Polyps Key points Polyps are non-cancerous growths that form on the inner lining of the colon and rectum The most common type is called an adenoma While it may take many years, adenomas can become invasive rectal cancer Cancer that forms in an adenoma is called an adenocarcinoma This is the most common type of rectal cancer Polyps that rarely turn into cancer include hyperplastic and inflammatory polyps While most polyps do not become cancer, almost all rectal cancers start in a polyp Removing polyps can prevent cancer before it starts Most can be removed during a colonoscopy using a minor surgical procedure called a polypectomy Polyps can also be tested to make sure that cancer hasn't already started to form For more information on finding polyps early, see the NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Colorectal Cancer Screening at NCCN.org/ patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app The rectum is the last part of the large bowel Stool is held in the rectum until it leaves the body through the anus Polyps are non-cancerous growths that form on the inner lining of the colon and rectum Most rectal cancers start in polyps called adenomas These cancers are called adenocarcinomas. 2 Testing and treatment planning Mismatch repair testing Family health history Blood tests Imaging Fertility and family planning Key points This chapter discusses testing and other steps needed to create your treatment plan Mismatch repair testing Everyone diagnosed with rectal cancer should have their tumor tested for mutations (changes) in genes that fix damaged DNA, called mismatch repair (MMR) genes This feature of some rectal cancers is a type of biomarker Biomarkers are targetable changes of a cancer that can help guide treatment Testing involves analyzing a piece of the rectal tumor in a lab Depending on the method used, an abnormal result is called either: mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) Tumors that do not have these changes are referred to as: microsatellite stable (MSS) or mismatch repair proficient (pMMR) If the cancer is dMMR/MSI-H, you will also be tested for inherited mutations in the mismatch repair genes (explained next) Family health history Most rectal cancers occur for unknown reasons While rare, some people are born with a gene mutation that makes them more likely to get rectal and other cancers People born with Lynch syndrome, for example, are at high risk of developing colorectal, endometrial, and ovarian cancers Lynch syndrome is caused by inherited mutations in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes Everyone diagnosed with rectal cancer should have their tumor tested for mutations in the MMR genes If the cancer is dMMR/MSI-H, you will also be tested for Lynch syndrome Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is another rare inherited cancer syndrome FAP can cause hundreds to thousands of polyps to form in the colon and rectum The polyps start as benign growths, but over time can become invasive rectal cancer",

potential options Intravesical chemotherapy Chemotherapy is a drug used to kill actively growing cancer cells Intravesical chemotherapy is given to treat the cancer and to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence Intravesical chemotherapy can be given soon after a TURBT procedure The treatment is a one-time dose instilled within 24 hours of TURBT surgery It\u2019s meant to \u201cclean up\u201d any cancer cells that surgery may have left behind and to prevent any new cancer from growing Intravesical chemotherapy may also be an option if BCG is unavailable, or if you were given BCG therapy but it wasn\u2019t effective In these cases, it\u2019s given on the same schedule as BCG therapy: once a week for 6 weeks, usually beginning 3 to 4 weeks after TURBT Maintenance intravesical chemotherapy, if given, is usually on a monthly basis for 1 to 2 years Because intravesical chemotherapy only goes into the bladder, not the entire body, it doesn\u2019t usually cause the harsh side effects that chemotherapy is known for However, it may cause the same type of side effects as intravesical BCG therapy BCG shortage Even though BCG has been used for decades to treat bladder cancer, it\u2019s been in short supply in the United States and worldwide for several years As a result, many people with non\u2013muscle-invasive bladder cancer haven\u2019t been able to receive this treatment or have received a reduced dose Patients with the highest risk are given the first opportunity to receive it If a regular course of BCG treatment isn\u2019t available to you, your treatment team may offer intravesical treatment with chemotherapy instead Other options include: Reduced doses or a shorter course of BCG treatment Eliminating BCG maintenance therapy Bladder removal surgery (for those at high risk of the cancer returning after treatment) Joining a clinical trial Systemic therapy Systemic therapy means a treatment that affects the whole body It\u2019s generally given directly into a vein (intravenously, or IV) The most common types of systemic therapy for bladder cancer are chemotherapy and immunotherapy To determine which type of systemic therapy is best for you, your treatment team will consider your overall health This includes how your heart, liver, and kidneys are functioning, how far the cancer has progressed, and your ability to do day-to-day activities Note that systemic chemotherapy is different than intravesical chemotherapy Systemic chemotherapy is a whole-body therapy Intravesical chemotherapy only affects the inside of the bladder Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is treatment with drugs to kill cancer cells Most chemotherapy drugs are liquids that are slowly injected into a vein (infusion) The drugs travel in your bloodstream to treat cancer throughout your body Chemotherapy may also harm some healthy cells, which is why it can cause harsh side effects Talk to your care team about any potential side effects from your chemotherapy treatment Chemotherapy may be given before surgery or sometimes after surgery depending on your type or stage of bladder cancer Chemotherapy alone (without surgery) is sometimes the main treatment for people who have metastatic bladder cancer What is dose-dense chemotherapy The term dose-dense refers to a method of speeding up chemotherapy by shortening the amount of time in between treatments (doses) The most common systemic chemotherapy used to treat bladder cancer is a combination of medicines known as dose-dense methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (or ddMVAC) A commonly used chemotherapy for bladder cancer is cisplatin, which contains the metal platinum Platinum-based chemotherapy medicines can be effective against bladder cancer but can also damage the kidneys People with kidney conditions or other health issues may not be able to have chemotherapy or, if possible, may receive non-platinum chemotherapy medicine Chemotherapy is given in a sequence of treatments called a cycle A cycle includes a period of treatments (such as once-a-day for a few days) followed by a time of rest (several days or weeks) This treatment cycle is then repeated a few times For example, you might have 3 to 6 cycles of chemotherapy over 2 to 3 months Immunotherapy Immunotherapy is a type of systemic therapy that uses your immune system (your body\u2019s natural defense against infection and disease) to find and destroy cancer cells Checkpoint inhibitors are one type of immunotherapy used to treat bladder cancer and other cancers Checkpoint inhibitors block

colorectal cancer is being diagnosed more often in young adults Some cancer treatments make it hard or impossible to have children Radiation therapy, for example, is used to treat many rectal cancers Radiation damages the hormonemaking function of the ovaries and testicles This can cause the inability to conceive a child Damage to the ovaries is known as premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) or radiation-induced premature menopause See the Survivorship chapter of this guide for more information on this side effect If you want the option of having children after treatment or are unsure, tell your care team Your doctor will discuss any fertility-related risks of your treatment plan with you You may be referred for counseling about your fertility preservation options Some are described next Sperm banking Sperm banking stores semen for later use by freezing it in liquid nitrogen The medical term for this is semen cryopreservation Egg freezing Like sperm banking, unfertilized eggs can be removed, frozen, and stored for later use The medical term for this is oocyte cryopreservation For more information on fertility and family planning, see the NCCN Guidelines for Patients for Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer at NCCN.org/ patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app Ovarian tissue banking This method involves removing part or all of an ovary and freezing the part that contains the eggs The frozen tissue that contains the eggs can later be unfrozen and put back in the body Ovarian transposition Rectal cancer treatment may involve external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) Radiation damages the ovaries and causes them to stop producing hormones needed for natural pregnancy Ovarian transposition is a surgery that moves one or both ovaries out of the range of the radiation beam The medical name for this procedure is oophoropexy Key points All rectal tumors should be tested for mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) or high microsatellite

Diet and lifestyle No one particular diet has been found to cause prostate cancer or to prevent it However, eating food that\u2019s high in fat, such as meat and dairy products, has been linked with an increased risk of prostate cancer Smoking and obesity also increase the risks of developing and dying from prostate cancer On the other hand, those who eat more fruits and vegetables have a lower risk of developing advanced prostate cancer Exercise and maintaining a healthy weight may also decrease the aggressiveness of prostate cancer and the likelihood of dying from it Early vs. advanced prostate cancer Early-stage prostate cancer has not visibly spread beyond the prostate It usually grows slowly and stays in the prostate This is also called localized prostate cancer Advanced-stage prostate cancer has grown outside the prostate and spread to other areas in the body such as distant lymph nodes (bottom left), bones, or organs like the liver or lungs (bottom right) This is also called metastatic prostate cancer What is advanced-stage prostate cancer Prostate cancer can be grouped into earlystage cancer or advanced-stage cancer Early stage Early-stage prostate cancer has not spread beyond the prostate The cancer usually grows slowly and stays in the prostate Cancer that is contained entirely within the prostate is called localized prostate cancer More information about early-stage prostate cancer can be found in the NCCN Guideline for Patients: Early-Stage Prostate Cancer at NCCN. org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app Advanced stage Advanced stage means that the cancer has spread beyond the prostate to other areas in the body This spreading is called metastasis or metastatic cancer Metastatic prostate cancer may spread to the lymph nodes, bones, liver, lungs, and other organs This book is all about advanced-stage prostate cancer Cancer that grows from the prostate gland to nearby areas such as lymph nodes, but no farther, is called regional prostate cancer. (It\u2019s also called locally advanced prostate cancer This book will call it regional prostate cancer to avoid confusion between localized and locally advanced.) Cancer that spreads beyond the prostate to other parts of the body is called distant metastatic prostate cancer or simply metastatic prostate cancer How does prostate cancer spread Cancer cells use the bloodstream like a highway to travel to distant areas in the body Cancer cells can also spread through the lymphatic system The lymphatic system is a network of organs and vessels that fights infections and circulates a clear fluid called lymph throughout the body A normal and important part of the lymphatic system are the lymph nodes Lymph nodes are small, disease-fighting clusters that filter lymph fluid to remove germs Lymph vessels and nodes are found everywhere in the body Some patients have advanced-stage prostate cancer when they\u2019re first diagnosed Others develop advanced-stage cancer after having treatment for early-stage cancer Can prostate cancer be cured Advanced-stage prostate cancer is usually a life-long disease But treatment can slow down its growth, reduce symptoms, and prolong life Treatments for advancedstage prostate cancer include hormone therapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, radiopharmaceuticals, surgery, and other therapies It\u2019s true that prostate cancer in the advanced stage can be fatal for some patients But in the past few years, improved detection methods and better treatments have been reducing the number of deaths from prostate cancer in patients of all races and ethnicities Many people with advanced-stage prostate cancer continue to live with the cancer and, in the end, may die from something else Scientists have learned a great deal about prostate cancer in recent years As a result, today\u2019s detection methods and treatments work better than those in the past Also, many patients with prostate cancer have more treatment choices now than they had before What\u2019s the best treatment The best treatment for prostate cancer is the treatment that\u2019s right for you Your

involves removing one or both ovaries and fallopian tubes but leaving the uterus in place Surgery to remove one ovary and its fallopian tube is called a unilateral salpingooophorectomy (USO) USO is only an option if the cancer is in 1 ovary and the cancer is appropriate for this procedure After a USO, you may still be able to become pregnant naturally if you haven\u2019t entered menopause If the cancer is in both ovaries, a BSO (without hysterectomy) may be an option While you can't become pregnant naturally after a BSO, pregnancy may be possible using assisted reproductive approaches One such approach is in vitro fertilization (IVF) In IVF, eggs are fertilized with sperm in a lab to create embryos The embryos are implanted into the uterus or frozen for future use The eggs used for IVF may be yours (removed from your ovary before surgery) or donor eggs Donor eggs are removed from women who have volunteered to go through hormone treatment to stimulate egg production in the ovaries Surgical methods A laparotomy is the most common method for ovarian cancer surgery A laparotomy is a long surgical cut in the abdomen It is often an upand-down (vertical) cut from the top of the belly button down to the pelvic bone This lets your doctor see the tumor and other organs and tissues in your abdomen and pelvis This method is recommended most often when surgical staging (described next) or cytoreductive surgery is planned Less often, a minimally invasive type of surgery called laparoscopy may be used The surgery is performed through a few small cuts in the abdomen Laparoscopy may be used in select cases, such as when cancer is only in the ovaries This surgery should only be done by a gynecologic oncologist experienced in this method Hysterectomy and BSO The most commonly used surgery for ovarian cancer removes the uterus, both ovaries, and both fallopian tubes Surgical staging If it does not look like the cancer has spread, surgical staging should be performed Surgical staging is the most accurate way to stage ovarian cancer This involves taking samples during surgery from organs and tissues where ovarian cancer often spreads The samples are tested for cancer cells Your surgeon will also take samples from nearby tissues where it looks like cancer hasn\u2019t spread This is done to check for cancer cells that have spread outside the ovaries or pelvis and can only be seen with a microscope These are called microscopic metastases The omentum and sometimes nearby lymph nodes will be removed The omentum is the fatty layer of tissue that covers organs in the belly (abdomen) Lymph nodes are groups of disease-fighting cells where cancer can also spread If there is fluid buildup in the abdomen, the fluid will also be sampled If there isn\u2019t fluid buildup, your doctor may \u201crinse\u201d the space inside your belly with a special liquid This is called a peritoneal washing Samples of the liquid will then be tested for cancer cells Preparing for surgery Your treatment team will give you instructions on how to prepare for surgery You may be asked to stop taking some medicines for a short time You also should not eat or drink after midnight the night before the surgery On the day of your surgery, you will be given medicine to put you into a deep sleep so you won\u2019t feel pain This is called general anesthesia Surgery may take 3 or more hours to complete More or less time may be needed depending on how much tissue is removed After the surgery, expect to stay in the hospital for a few days or weeks to recover You may feel some pain and tenderness in your belly and pelvis It may last for a few days or weeks You may be able to return to normal activities in a few weeks The time it takes to fully recover varies from person to person It

area (locally progressive) or whether it has spread to areas far from the pelvis (metastatic disease) See page 26 for information on the treatment of metastatic anal cancer Treatment for locally progressive anal cancer is similar to recurrent non-metastatic anal cancer Surgery to remove the anus is recommended See Recurrence on the next page for more information Before proceeding with

other and can happen to anyone. \u2013 Janet Anal cancer survivor Recurrence Recurrence is the return of cancer after a cancer-free period Treatment depends on whether the cancer returns to the anus, to lymph nodes near the anus, or to distant areas such as the liver or lungs See page 26 for information on the treatment of metastatic anal cancer If cancer returns to the anus If cancer returns to the anal area, surgery to remove the anus is recommended This type of surgery is called abdominoperineal resection (APR) APR is a fairly radical surgery that requires cutting into the abdomen and into the area between the anus and genitals (the perineum) to reach and remove the cancer This type of surgery is also used for some rectal cancers In addition to the anus, APR typically involves removing the rectum, the area where the rectum and colon meet, and the fatty tissue surrounding the rectum Lymph nodes in the groin will also be removed during surgery if any are known to have cancer This is known as a groin dissection Radiation treatment for anal cancer weakens and damages the perineum, which can interfere with healing after APR In some cases, closing the wound requires taking tissue from another area of the body This is known as muscle flap reconstruction It can improve healing of the perineum and reduce complications after surgery A muscle in the lower abdomen called the rectus abdominis, along with skin, fat, and blood vessels, is often used for reconstruction If APR is planned, ask your doctor about muscle flap reconstruction Abdominoperineal resection (APR) APR may be needed for anal cancer that does not respond to initial treatment or that returns after treatment It involves removing the anus and creating a permanent colostomy for stool to leave the body Removing the anus means there is no natural way for stool to exit the body A permanent colostomy is needed A colostomy connects the end of the colon to the outside of the abdomen This creates an opening, called a stoma, on the surface of the abdomen Stool exits the body through the stoma and goes into a bag attached to the skin If cancer returns to lymph nodes Treatment of cancer found in lymph nodes during surveillance depends on whether radiation was used as part of initial treatment Prior radiation therapy Radiation therapy is almost always used as part of initial treatment for anal cancer It is generally not used again to treat cancer that returns to nearby lymph nodes However, further radiation therapy may be considered in select cases Otherwise, a lymph node dissection may be needed If APR is planned, the cancerous lymph nodes will be removed during APR If APR is not planned, a lymph node dissection can be performed as a standalone surgery Chemotherapy is also an option for treating

is the most important biomarker used to plan ovarian cancer treatment Everyone diagnosed with ovarian cancer should have the tumor tested for mutations in the BRCA genes, and in other similar genes important in DNA repair This is different than genetic testing of the blood for inherited (germline) BRCA mutations Mutations in the tumor itself are known as somatic or simply \u201ctumor\u201d mutations BRCA mutations are a form of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) This means that if you have a BRCA mutation, the cancer is also homologous recombination deficient or HRD positive However, you can also have an HRD-positive tumor without a BRCA mutation Other changes in the tumor\u2019s DNA can make it homologous recombination deficient The tumor's BRCA and HRD status are used to guide decisions about maintenance therapy after initial treatment Other biomarkers The timing of testing for the biomarkers described next can vary Some providers test for these (in addition to BRCA) early in the treatment process Others may only test for BRCA and wait to see if therapies that require other biomarkers are needed However, testing for these biomarkers is generally recommended

suspected ovarian cancer include a CBC, chemistry profile, liver function tests, and tumor marker tests Hereditary ovarian cancer is most often caused by a mutation in the BRCA genes Families with a history of Lynch syndrome may also be at risk for ovarian and other cancers Everyone diagnosed with ovarian cancer should have genetic testing of the blood for inherited (germline) BRCA mutations

Clinical trials Key points The most common types of ovarian cancer are high-grade serous carcinoma and high-grade endometrioid carcinoma These cancers are treated with surgery and chemotherapy If treatment works well, maintenance therapy may be an option for more advanced cancers Surgery Surgery is often the first treatment if you are willing and able to have it Sometimes chemotherapy is given first Surgery should be performed by a gynecologic oncologist This is a surgeon who is an expert in cancers that start in the female reproductive organs If your team recommends chemotherapy before surgery, see page The main goals of surgery are to: Remove all or as much of the cancer as possible, and Learn how far the cancer has spread Hysterectomy with BSO The most common surgery for ovarian cancer is hysterectomy and bilateral salpingooophorectomy (BSO) A hysterectomy is surgery to remove the uterus When the cervix is removed in addition to the uterus, it is called a total or complete hysterectomy A BSO removes both ovaries and both fallopian tubes Pregnancy isn\u2019t possible after a hysterectomy Fertility-sparing surgery (described below) may be an option for some very early ovarian cancers that haven't spread beyond the ovaries If cancer has spread outside the ovaries, your surgeon will attempt to remove as much of it as possible This is called debulking or cytoreductive surgery The extent of the surgery depends on how far the cancer has spread It may involve removing all or part of nearby organs Lymph nodes that look abnormal or that are larger than normal will also

occur for unknown reasons While rare, some people are born with a disorder that makes them more likely to get colon and other cancers These are called inherited cancer syndromes Two such conditions include Lynch syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) People born with Lynch syndrome are at high risk of developing colon, endometrial, and ovarian cancers Lynch syndrome is caused by inherited mutations of the MMR genes For cancers found to have the dMMR/MSI-H biomarker, testing for Lynch syndrome is recommended FAP causes hundreds to thousands of polyps to form in the colon and rectum The polyps start as benign growths, but over time can become invasive colon cancer Cancer often develops by age 50 in people with classic FAP A milder form (attenuated FAP) causes fewer polyps and usually starts later in life If an inherited syndrome is suspected, your doctor will refer you to a genetic counselor This expert can speak with you and your family about testing for syndromes related to colon cancer To be tested, you must provide a sample of blood or saliva A pathologist tests the sample for gene mutations that cause these syndromes It is important to meet with a genetic counselor before having any genetic testing Blood tests The following tests are not used alone to diagnose colon cancer, but abnormal results may signal health problems Complete blood count Cancer and other health problems can cause low or high blood cell counts A complete blood count (CBC) measures the number of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets in a blood sample White blood cells help the body to fight infection Red blood cells carry oxygen throughout the body Platelets help wounds heal by forming blood clots Chemistry profile Also known as a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), this group of tests provides information about how well your kidneys, liver, and other organs are working CEA blood test Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a protein found in blood The level of CEA is often higher than normal in people with colon cancer, especially if the cancer has spread to other organs Monitoring CEA can be helpful even when the cancer is only in the colon and the level is normal, because the level will rise if the cancer later spreads to other organs However, monitoring CEA is not helpful for everyone, even if the cancer has spread People who are pregnant and those who smoke may have higher CEA levels. 66 I was diagnosed in the ER at age 44, 58 days after my wedding, and I faced biases and unexpected challenges I had to fight to get care because I was dismissed

be true to yourself Before any diagnosis, put on your life jacket first\u2014take care of yourself Get screened, know your family history When facing colorectal cancer, the best care begins with self-care.\" ctDNA There is growing interest in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) testing for people with earlystage colon cancer Also called a liquid biopsy, this test looks for small pieces of DNA released by tumor cells into the blood It can detect microscopic disease that may remain in the body after colectomy This information may be helpful in predicting the risk of the cancer returning or other outcomes But more information is needed, and at this time ctDNA testing is only recommended as part of a clinical trial Imaging Imaging tests can show areas of cancer inside the body A

teeth, upper and lower jaw, and surrounding structures and tissues It is commonly performed by dentists and oral surgeons in everyday practice and may be used to plan treatment for dentures, braces, extractions, and implants Scoping procedures Some imaging tests use a thin, tube-shaped tool called a scope that is inserted into the mouth or nose body to examine the oropharynx and to take pictures One end of the scope has a small light and camera lens to see inside your body The image is sent to a television or computer monitor This will also help guide your doctor in performing a biopsy More than one type of scope may be used for imaging tests The type of scope often used for head and cancer is called an endoscope An endoscope is often guided into the body through the mouth or nose Endoscopy might be used to determine the size and spread of tumor and to take a tumor sample Before an endoscopy, you will be given a topical spray to numb the throat Some possible endoscopies are described next You might not have an endoscopy Fiberoptic nasopharyngolaryngoscopy Fiberoptic nasopharyngolaryngoscopy is used to examine the larynx (voice box) and nearby structures It is done while you are awake with a topical spray to make you more comfortable Laryngoscopy and nasolaryngoscopy Laryngoscopy is an exam of the back of your throat, including your voice box (larynx) or behind your voice box (hypopharynx) It uses a laryngoscope, which is a thin, long tube fitted with a fiberoptic light Your voice box contains your vocal cords and allows you to speak A laryngoscope is used to look for tumors in the throat and voice box (larynx) and hypopharynx Laryngoscopy may be done in different ways: Indirect laryngoscopy uses a small mirror held at the back of your throat The doctor shines a light on the mirror to view the throat area Medicine to numb the back of your throat may be used Fiberoptic laryngoscopy (nasolaryngoscopy) uses a small flexible scope passed through your nose and into your throat Numbing medicine will be sprayed in your nose This procedure typically takes less than 1 minute Direct laryngoscopy is a more detailed exam performed under general anesthesia in an operating room It uses a scope called a laryngoscope placed in the back of your throat This procedure allows the doctor to see deeper in the throat and to take a tissue sample for a biopsy The purpose of direct laryngoscopy is to identify the primary (main) tumor and determine if it is resectable (can be removed with surgery) Esophagoscopy In an esophagoscopy, a device is guided down the throat into the esophagus It is performed under anesthesia in an operating room This allows the doctor to examine your esophagus (swallowing tube) for abnormal growths Bronchoscopy During a bronchoscopy, a device is inserted through the nose or mouth to examine the inside of your airway, including the trachea and bronchi Bronchoscopy may be used to detect cancer or to perform some treatment procedures It is done under anesthesia to make you more comfortable Panendoscopy During a panendoscopy, different types of endoscopes are passed down the mouth or nose to do a laryngoscopy, pharyngoscopy, esophagoscopy, or bronchoscopy This allows a doctor to thoroughly examine the mouth, oropharynx, larynx (voice box), esophagus (tube leading to the stomach), and trachea (windpipe) and bronchi (breathing passages in the lungs) It is performed under anesthesia to make you more comfortable This procedure might be done to look for other tumors if it is unclear where the cancer started, or if the lymph nodes in the bottom part of the neck seem abnormal A biopsy of any tumors or other abnormal areas might be taken Biopsies can be done with special tools that are used through the

sense for you This choice is based on your cancer stage as well as your overall health and personal preferences Very often, the best option includes more than one type of therapy Common treatments for bladder cancer include: Surgery Chemotherapy Immunotherapy Radiation therapy Targeted therapy Surgery, by itself or with other treatments, can be used in many stages of bladder cancer For less advanced cancer, a minor surgical procedure can be used to remove just the tumor For more advanced cancer, the entire bladder can be surgically removed In addition, you may receive chemotherapy or immunotherapy directly into the bladder For people with metastatic bladder cancer, chemotherapy or immunotherapy is used to treat cancer anywhere in the body Another treatment option is to join a clinical trial You\u2019ll also receive treatment for any side effects caused by cancer therapy Can bladder cancer be cured Bladder cancer in an early (non-invasive) stage can usually be cured Treatment for more advanced stage (muscle-invasive) bladder cancer can be complicated but it may still get rid of the cancer Metastatic bladder cancer is not typically curable, but it is still treatable And treatments are improving all the time For most people with bladder cancer, treatment provides a longer and more comfortable life with fewer symptoms It\u2019s important to know that bladder cancer commonly comes back even after treatment In fact, bladder cancer is more likely to come back than almost any other kind of cancer From now on, you and your health care providers will have to keep watching for any sign that the cancer returns Even so, there\u2019s hope If the cancer does come back, it can be treated Many people live with bladder cancer and still have a good quality of life Plus, new and improved ways to detect and treat bladder cancer are helping people live longer and with fewer side effects than ever before Experts predict that treatment will improve rapidly over the next few years, with better results for all stages of bladder cancer As a result of clinical trials, many new treatments for bladder cancer have been approved or are on the horizon As always, you can try to join a clinical trial at almost any point during cancer care Key points Bladder cancer happens when abnormal cells in the inner layer of the bladder grow out of control The most common symptom of bladder cancer is blood in the urine Bladder cancer comes from abnormal changes (mutations) in the genes of cells Smoking is the greatest risk factor for bladder cancer Many bladder cancers can be cured All bladder cancers can be treated For most people with bladder cancer, treatment requires more than one type of therapy Bladder cancer very often comes back even after treatment You and

immune system This leads to a higher risk of infections Being an older adult Although primary CNS lymphoma can occur at any age, the majority of people diagnosed with it are in their 60s or 70s How is primary CNS lymphoma diagnosed Primary CNS lymphoma is often found when a person develops symptoms A symptom is a feeling or problem that may be a sign of disease Symptoms usually develop over several weeks Primary CNS lymphoma can cause a variety of symptoms Symptoms are often related to the lymphoma\u2019s location in the central nervous system The most common location is in the central part of the brain A lymphoma located here may cause specific nerve changes such as leg or arm weakness, or problems with coordination or movement Other such symptoms may include changes in personality or behavior, depression, confusion, memory problems, loss of bladder control (incontinence), or difficulty speaking or swallowing As the lymphoma tumor grows, it puts pressure on the CNS This pressure often leads to neurological symptoms and difficulties, including headaches, nausea, vomiting, or seizures Changes in eyesight, such as blurry vision or double vision, can also occur You\u2019ll need several tests to confirm whether you have primary CNS lymphoma or a lymphoma that started in another part of your body, or a different disease with similar symptoms Important tests include a neurological exam, imaging (MRI or CT scan), and biopsies A biopsy means taking a sample of fluid or tissue from your body to look for cancer You\u2019ll also have blood tests, an eye exam, and other tests If these tests show that you have primary CNS lymphoma, your care team should discuss your treatment options with you If possible, seek care at a center with experience in treating lymphomas in the brain Can primary CNS lymphoma be cured Curing primary CNS lymphoma is rare, but it may be possible if it\u2019s diagnosed early and treated immediately Sometimes the bigger problem is managing the major side effects of the intense treatment People who are younger, healthier, and more physically fit have a better chance for a cure In most people, primary CNS lymphoma can\u2019t be cured, but it can be treated Treatment can slow down its growth and reduce its symptoms for a period of time, and prolong life The main treatments for primary CNS lymphoma include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, stem cell transplant, or a combination of these treatments Joining a clinical trial of a potential new therapy is another recommended option Treatment may be able to put primary CNS lymphoma into remission Remission means there are no symptoms or signs of cancer Remission may last for months or years However, even with the best treatment, primary CNS lymphoma often comes back (relapses) in the brain, spinal cord, or the eye It\u2019s true that primary CNS lymphoma is fatal for some patients Anyone diagnosed with primary CNS lymphoma has a difficult road ahead Still, there\u2019s hope In the past few years, improved detection methods have shortened the time to diagnosis and led to better outcomes, even in people with weakened immune systems Therapies specifically designed to treat primary CNS lymphoma are currently being studied in clinical trials The number of these trials has increased in recent years, offering more hope to people living with this disease What\u2019s next

the eyes What\u2019s next Key points Treatment should start soon after being diagnosed with primary CNS lymphoma This chapter describes what to expect from the treatment process and explains the options for each phase of treatment Although there are different treatment options for primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma, the treatment approach is often a two-step process The first step is the induction phase, which aims to wipe out all lymphoma cells or as many as possible The goal of the second step, the consolidation phase, is to destroy any cancer cells that may remain in the body after the first phase Consolidation is also for preventing the lymphoma from returning Induction The first (induction) phase of treatment can last several months Treatment typically requires multiple courses of chemotherapy, which are given while in the hospital The options for induction treatment are listed in Guide 1 and discussed here: Clinical trial Clinical trials allow you to receive treatment while also helping researchers learn more about this uncommon cancer Everyone with primary CNS lymphoma is encouraged to consider enrolling in a clinical trial The treatment you receive in the trial may or may not work better than the standard treatments for primary CNS lymphoma Ask your care team if there is a clinical trial you may be eligible for If you don\u2019t want to join a clinical trial or none are available for you, the recommended induction treatment is high-dose methotrexate chemotherapy, often given with other chemotherapies High-dose chemotherapy The most effective chemotherapy drug for primary CNS lymphoma is methotrexate Methotrexate has been used for many years to treat a variety of cancers It works by blocking the body\u2019s use of folate, a form of vitamin B Lymphoma cells can\u2019t multiply and spread as quickly without folate High doses of methotrexate are needed to overcome the blood-brain barrier and still have enough strength to kill lymphoma cells The blood-brain barrier is a protective layer around the brain that prevents germs, infections, and other toxins from getting in But it also blocks some chemotherapy drugs like methotrexate from reaching the brain For induction therapy, high-dose methotrexate is given together with the immunotherapy drug rituximab (Rituxan) Rituximab can be given on its own but it usually works better when given with chemotherapy In addition to methotrexate and rituximab, one or more other chemotherapy medicines such as temozolomide, vincristine, and procarbazine may also be included Alternatives to methotrexate High-dose methotrexate (with or without additional medicines) is the preferred induction therapy for primary CNS lymphoma But it\u2019s not the best option for everyone Your treatment team may recommend a different induction therapy if: Your kidneys aren\u2019t working well High-dose chemotherapy is too intense or risky for you Cancer was found in your spine or spinal fluid If you can\u2019t have high-dose methotrexate, other options for induction therapy include: Ibrutinib (Imbruvica) or similar medication Temozolomide (Temodar) Rituximab with or without

recommended every year for 3 years after any type of treatment for recurrence You may have CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast, or CT of the chest without contrast and an MRI of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast Lymph node exams Inguinal lymph node exams are recommended every 3 to 6 months for 5 years after any type of treatment for recurrence Digital rectal exams If you had treatment for cancer in lymph nodes only (you did not have APR), digital rectal exams (DREs) are recommended every 3 to 6 months for 5 years Anoscopy If you had treatment for cancer in lymph nodes only (you did not have APR), anoscopy is recommended every 6 to 12 months for 3 years In some patients, after treatment with radiation therapy, anoscopy may not be possible due to discomfort or pain

diagnosed with a brain tumor can be frightening and overwhelming This book will help you make sense of all the information that\u2019s out there It will also describe your options for treatment Gliomas can be challenging to treat, but treatment is improving What is a glioma A glioma is a type of tumor that grows in the brain A tumor is an abnormal growth of cells Gliomas develop from certain brain cells called glial cells Glial cells support the function of nerve cells (neurons) in the central nervous system (the brain and the spinal cord) Many types of tumors can occur in the central nervous system Only those that start as glial cells become gliomas Gliomas are the most common type of malignant (cancerous) brain tumor in adults Gliomas can happen at any age but occur more often in adults than in children Gliomas start in the brain or sometimes the spinal cord But they rarely spread to another area of the body What makes gliomas so complicated is that they invade and blend into the normal parts of the brain So gliomas can be very difficult to treat without harming the healthy parts of the brain Normal cells vs. cancer cells Normal cells follow the body\u2019s rules Normal cells increase in number only when they\u2019re needed, and they die when they\u2019re old or damaged Cancer cells don\u2019t follow the rules Cancer cells can multiply quickly and avoid dying Cancer cells can crowd out normal cells and take their place Eventually this damages the body and often results in symptoms What causes a glioma No one knows exactly what causes most brain tumors, including gliomas What experts do know is that brain tumors often start with an abnormality (mutation) in certain cells This abnormality causes these cells to grow out of control (become cancerous) This type of mutation happens on its own It\u2019s not typically passed down in families (hereditary mutation) Gliomas occur in both children and adults This book discusses gliomas only in adults Are there types of gliomas There are several types of glioma tumors The 3 most common types are astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, and glioblastomas They\u2019re made of different kinds of glial cells Astrocytomas look like star-shaped glial cells called astrocytes The main job of astrocytes is to maintain the chemical environment that allows communication between nerve cells Oligodendrogliomas look like oligodendrocytes, which are glial cells that protect electrical signaling in nerve cells Glioblastomas come from precursor cells that develop into cells like astrocytes and oligodendrocytes Glioblastomas are the most destructive and dangerous type of glioma tumor Besides tumor type, gliomas are also categorized by grade The grade indicates how fast the tumor is likely to grow A low-grade glioma usually grows slowly while a high-grade glioma often grows rapidly Although it helps to put gliomas into categories, it\u2019s important to note that each glioma has its own molecular characteristics and behavior That also means that each person\u2019s glioma is unique So your progress and experience will be unique to you Gliomas often occur in the upper part of the brain where they can disrupt important brain functions Few gliomas in adults have distinct and welldefined edges like the one in this illustration Most gliomas blend deeply into normal brain tissue and have vague borders This makes them very difficult to remove entirely When the tumor is removed, some tumor cells must be left behind to avoid damaging nearby brain tissue How are gliomas diagnosed A glioma is often found when it starts causing symptoms A symptom is a problem or feeling that may be a sign of disease Gliomas cause symptoms when they put pressure on the brain or invade brain tissue Some people have many symptoms while others don\u2019t have any Common symptoms of gliomas include: Unusual or frequent headaches Seizures Changes in personality or mood Nausea and vomiting Difficulty speaking or swallowing Muscle weakness Difficulty with walking, balance, or coordination Symptoms provide clues that something is wrong But they don\u2019t provide enough information to identify a specific illness Different tests, physical exams, and surgical procedures are required to diagnose a glioma If these tests show that you have a glioma, your care team will discuss your treatment

expert in the diagnosis of AML This review is often referred to as histology, histopathology, or hematopathology review The pathologist will note the overall appearance and the size, shape, and type of cells Tests will be done on the biopsied cells There are 2 types of bone marrow tests that are often done at the same time: Bone marrow aspirate Bone marrow biopsy A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy are bedside procedures They are not surgeries and do not require an operating room Your care team will try to make you as comfortable as possible during the procedures In some places, sedation or anesthesia is provided during these procedures The samples are usually taken from the back of the hip bone (pelvis) You will likely lie on your belly or side For an aspirate, a hollow needle will be pushed through your skin and into the bone Liquid bone marrow will then be drawn into a syringe For the biopsy, a wider needle will be used to remove a small piece of bone You may feel bone pain at your hip for a few days Your skin may bruise If the blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) subtype of AML is suspected, you might also have a lymph node biopsy or a skin lesion biopsy Flow cytometry Flow cytometry is a laboratory method used to detect, identify, and count specific cells Flow cytometry involves adding a light-sensitive dye to cells The dyed cells are passed through a beam of light in a machine The machine measures the number of cells, as well as things like the size and shape of the cells Flow cytometry may be used on cells from circulating (peripheral) blood or from a bone marrow aspirate A blood test can count the number of white blood cells, but it cannot detect the subtle differences between different types of blood cancers Flow cytometry can detect these subtle differences The most common use of flow cytometry is in the identification of markers on cells, particularly in the immune system (called immunophenotyping) Immunophenotyping Immunophenotyping is a process that uses antibodies to detect the presence or absence of white blood cell antigens called biomarkers These antigens are proteins that can be found on the surface of or inside white blood cells Certain biomarkers are targeted in AML treatment Immunohistochemistry Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a special staining process that involves adding a chemical marker to cells The cells are then studied using a microscope IHC looks for the immunophenotype of cells from a biopsy or tissue sample Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy Samples of bone and liquid bone marrow are removed in a biopsy Testing for AML biomarker and genetic changes Biomarker and genetic tests are used to learn more about your subtype of AML, to target treatment, and to determine the likely path the cancer will take

over time, and not changes in the rest of the body\u2019s cells It is sometimes called molecular testing, tumor profiling, gene expression profiling, or genomic testing Inside our cells are DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) molecules These molecules are tightly packaged into what is called a chromosome Chromosomes contain most of the genetic information in a cell Normal human cells contain 23 pairs of chromosomes for a total of 46 chromosomes Each chromosome contains thousands of genes Genes are coded instructions for the proteins your cells make A mutation is when something goes wrong in the genetic code Proteins are given names such as FLTGenes are identified in italics like this: FLT AML cells sometimes have changes in genes and chromosomes that can be seen under a microscope or found with various other tests Testing of your leukemia cells can gather specific information about your leukemia to help guide treatment AML genetic changes AML cells can have changes in genes and

Microsatellites are short, repeated strings of DNA When errors or defects occur, they are fixed by mismatch repair (MMR) proteins Some cancers have DNA mutations or changes that prevent these errors from being fixed This is called microsatellite instability (MSI) or deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) When cancer cells have more than a normal number of microsatellites, it is called MSI-H (microsatellite instability-high) This is often due to dMMR genes PD-L1 testing Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is an immune protein If this protein is expressed on the surface of cancer cells, it

an abnormal digital rectal exam are signs of possible prostate cancer, the only way to confirm cancer is to have a biopsy A biopsy is a procedure in which a sample of cells or tissue is removed from your body and tested for cancer A biopsy is an invasive test, which means that it goes into (invades) your body All invasive tests have some risk The risks for a prostate biopsy include infection, bleeding, and pain Doctors use invasive tests only when needed You and your doctors will decide when, or if, you need a biopsy A biopsy procedure is usually performed by a urologist A urologist is a doctor who\u2019s an expert in treating diseases of the urinary system and the male reproductive organs For this procedure, you\u2019ll lie on your side with your knees curled up or you\u2019ll lie on your back with your legs raised You\u2019ll be given anesthesia to numb the pain or to put you to sleep The urologist will insert a lubricated probe into your rectum The probe provides a visual image of the prostate The urologist will then insert a hollow needle into the prostate gland using the video display to guide it The needle will be inserted either through the rectum or through the perineum (the skin between the anus and scrotum) When the urologist removes the needle, it will pull out a small sample of prostate tissue called a core A core sample is only 1 to 2 Biopsy of the prostate A biopsy removes a sample of tissue that is tested for cancer This is a transperineal biopsy, in which a needle is inserted through the perineum and into the prostate An ultrasound probe, which goes into the rectum, helps the doctor guide the needle into the prostate MRI scans of your prostate may be combined with the ultrasound image to provide a highly accurate picture of the cancer. millimiters wide and about 12 to 20 millimeters long\u2014about the width of a toothpick and the length of a raisin The urologist will typically take 12 or more core samples from different parts of the prostate Checking different areas provides a more complete evaluation of cancer throughout the gland After the biopsy samples are removed, they\u2019ll be sent to a lab for testing At the lab, a specialist called a pathologist will examine the samples under a microscope and test them for cancer The pathologist will find out how many of the core samples contain cancer and will also measure the percentage of cancer in each core With this information, the pathologist can estimate the amount of cancer in the prostate Also, by knowing where each core sample was taken, the pathologist can tell if the cancer is concentrated in a certain section of the prostate The pathologist will put these results into a report Ask your doctor to review the pathology report with you It\u2019s common to have more than one biopsy if you\u2019re on active surveillance You\u2019ll have one biopsy to determine your diagnosis and another biopsy within a year (called a confirmatory biopsy) to see if any changes have happened over time Having a biopsy may cause complications A complication is an unwanted and unplanned result from a procedure Complications may include infection, bleeding from the rectum, or blood in the urine, stool, or semen These usually go away after a few days or, with semen, after a few weeks However, it\u2019s important to know that a biopsy doesn\u2019t cause prostate cancer to

lab for testing A pathologist will examine the biopsy for cancer and write a report called a pathology report Ask questions about your biopsy results and what it means for your treatment There are different types of biopsies Some biopsies are guided using imaging, such as mammogram, ultrasound, or MRI The primary or main tumor is biopsied first Other tumors or tumors in different areas may also be biopsied You may have tissue removed from the breast, lymph nodes, or both Types of possible biopsies include: Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) or core biopsy (CB) uses needles of different sizes to remove a sample of tissue or fluid In a vacuum-assisted core biopsy (VACB), suction is used to remove the sample with a special vacuum device Incisional biopsy removes a small amount of tissue through a cut in the skin or body Excisional biopsy removes the entire abnormal area This is not the preferred type of biopsy but may be necessary if other methods are not possible or when the biopsy results don\u2019t match the expected findings Skin biopsy takes a small sample of inflamed skin on the breast Before biopsies are performed, usually the area is injected with numbing medicine A core needle biopsy (CNB) removes more than one tissue sample, but usually through the same area on the breast The samples are small Biopsy In a biopsy, a sample of tumor is removed There are different types of biopsy This image shows an ultrasound-guided needle biopsy The needle is often guided into the tumor with imaging When mammography is used during a biopsy, it is called a stereotactic needle biopsy One or more clips may be placed near the breast tumor during a biopsy The clips are small, painless, and made of metal They will mark the site for future treatment and imaging The clips will stay in place until surgery If the area biopsied is benign, the clip will remain in place to mark the biopsy site on future imaging The clips cause no problems, even if they are left in place for a long time You will be able to go through airport security and have an MRI There are both physical and emotional experiences in having biopsies You may need to rest and place an ice pack on the biopsy area after the procedure If you are working or have other commitments, you may want to take the day off to recover emotionally and physically from the experience Axillary lymph node needle biopsy An axillary lymph node (ALN) drains lymph fluid from the breast and nearby areas In an axillary lymph node biopsy, a sample of lymph node near the armpit (axilla) is biopsied with a needle This is to determine if abnormal lymph nodes seen on imaging tests contain cancer cells An ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (US-FNA) or core biopsy will be used If cancer is found, it is called node positive (node+) A marker may be placed in the node so that it can be identified later if needed Standard of care is the best known way to treat particular disease based on past clinical trials There may be more than one treatment regimen that is considered standard of care Ask your care team what treatment options are available and if a clinical trial might be right for you Sentinel lymph node biopsy A sentinel lymph node (SLN) is the first lymph node that cancer cells are most likely to spread to from a primary tumor Sometimes, there can be more than one sentinel lymph node Removal of the sentinel lymph nodes during surgery is called a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB or SNB) This procedure is done during surgery such as a mastectomy (surgery to remove the breast) or lumpectomy (surgery to remove the tumor) to determine if any cancer cells have traveled to the lymph nodes The lymph nodes removed are called the sentinel nodes They may or may not contain any cancer cells Just because these nodes are removed, it does not mean that they are positive for cancer To find the sentinel lymph nodes, a radioactive material and other dyes are injected into the area where breast tumor is located From here, the dye travels through the lymphatics in the breast to the lymph nodes This helps the surgeon find which of the nodes are the sentinel lymph nodes Once the nodes are found, those containing the

5 What is bone cancer? 6 What is bone? 7 What's in this book? 7 What can you do to get the best care Bone cancer includes a group of cancers that start in the bone or cartilage This is called primary bone cancer and differs from other types of cancers that can spread (metastasize) to the bone This chapter presents an overview of bone cancer What is bone cancer Cancers that start in the bone are called primary bone cancers Bone cancers that start in another part of the body (such as the breast, lungs, or kidney) and travel to the bones are called secondary bone malignancies or metastatic cancer Metastatic cancers to bone behave very differently from primary bone cancers Sarcomas Most primary bone cancers are sarcomas Sarcomas are a rare group of cancers There are 2 main types of sarcomas: Soft tissue sarcomas Bone sarcomas Soft tissue includes fat, muscles, nerves, tendons, blood and lymph vessels, and other supportive tissues of the body Soft tissue sarcomas are more common than bone sarcomas Bone sarcomas, such as osteosarcomas, start in the cells that form NCCN Guidelines for Patients\u00ae Bone Cancer, 2025 bone Osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and chondrosarcoma are the most common types of bone cancer, except multiple myeloma For more information, see NCCN Guidelines for Patients\u00ae: Soft Tissue Sarcoma and NCCN Guidelines for Patients\u00ae: Multiple Myeloma at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app Types of bone tumors A bone tumor is an abnormal growth of cells within a bone A bone tumor may be cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign) Bone tumors often occur in areas of the bone that grow rapidly (the metaphysis) This book will discuss the following: Chondrosarcoma \u2013 starts in the cells that form cartilage Cartilage is a tough, flexible tissue that covers the ends of bones to form a smooth surface that makes a joint Also, cartilage gives structure to the nose, ears, larynx, and other parts of the body Chordoma \u2013 starts in notochordal cells that form the spine and vertebrae Chordomas are usually found in the lower spinal column (sacrum) or at the base of the skull Ewing sarcoma \u2013 starts in the bone marrow and commonly occurs in the diaphysis of long bones or flat bones like the pelvis or scapula (shoulder blade) Giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB) \u2013 is an overgrowth of cells found in the part of the bone called the metaphysis and extends into the area of the bone that widens to form a joint (epiphysis) Osteosarcoma \u2013 starts in cells most commonly in the areas of the bone that grow rapidly (metaphysis), near the growth plates What is bone Bone is a living tissue made up of specialized bone cells and collagen Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body Bone tissue also contains blood vessels, nerves, proteins, vitamins, and minerals Bone is made up of the following: Compact bone or cortical bone \u2013 the hard, dense outer layer of bone that is covered by a membrane of strong connective tissue called the periosteum Spongey bone or cancellous bone \u2013 the spongy, porous inner layer of bone that contains red marrow Bone marrow \u2013 found in the center of most bones and has many blood vessels There are 2 types of bone marrow: red and yellow Red marrow contains blood stem cells that can become red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets Yellow marrow is made mostly of fat Red marrow is often replaced by yellow marrow as we age Why you should read this book Making decisions about cancer care can be stressful You may need to make tough decisions under pressure about complex choices The NCCN Guidelines for Patients are trusted by patients and providers They clearly explain current care recommendations made by respected experts in the field Recommendations are based on the latest research and practices at leading cancer centers Cancer care is not the same for everyone By following expert recommendations for your situation, you are

cancer HER2-targeted therapy is drug therapy that treats HER2 breast cancer Most often, HER2-targeted therapy is given with chemotherapy However, it might be used alone or in combination with endocrine therapy HER2-targeted therapies include: HER2 antibodies prevent growth signals from HER2 from outside the cell They also increase the attack of immune cells on cancer cells HER2 inhibitors stop growth signals from HER2 from within the cell HER2 conjugates or antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) deliver cellspecific chemotherapy They attach to HER2s then enter the cell Once inside, chemotherapy is released Your heart will be monitored before and during treatment with trastuzumab Tests will measure the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), the amount of blood pumping from the left side of the heart Inhibitors This section is for inhibitors that are different from inhibitors used in HER2-targeted therapy CDK4/6 inhibitors Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) is a cell protein that helps cells grow and divide For hormone receptor-positive , HER2- cancer, taking a CDK4/6 inhibitor with endocrine therapy may help control cancer longer With all CDK4/6 regimens, those who are premenopausal must also receive ovarian ablation or suppression CDK4/6 inhibitors include abemaciclib (Verzenio), palbociclib (Ibrance), and ribociclib (Kisqali). mTOR inhibitors mTOR is a cell protein that helps cells grow and divide Endocrine therapy may stop working if mTOR becomes overactive. mTOR inhibitors are used to get endocrine therapy working again Everolimus (Afinitor) is an mTOR inhibitor Most often, it is taken with exemestane For some, it may be taken with fulvestrant or tamoxifen PARP inhibitors Cancer cells often become damaged PARP is a cell protein that repairs cancer cells and allows them to survive Blocking PARP can cause cancer cells to die Olaparib (Lynparza) and talazoparib (Talzenna) are PARP inhibitors You must have the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and your breast cancer must be HER2- for PARP inhibitors to be considered Did you know The terms \u201cchemotherapy\u201d and \u201csystemic therapy\u201d are often used interchangeably, but they are not the same Systemic therapy works throughout the body and includes chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, endocrine therapy, and others PIK3CA inhibitor The PIK3CA gene is one of the most frequently mutated genes in breast cancers A mutation in this gene can lead to increased growth of cancer cells and resistance to various treatments Alpelisib (Piqray) is an example of a PIK3CA inhibitor Immunotherapy Immunotherapy is a type of systemic treatment that tries to re-activate the immune system against tumor cells The immune system has many on and off switches Tumors take advantage of \"off switches.\" Two leading off switches are PD-1 and CTLAImmunotherapy can be given alone or with other types of treatment An immunotherapy example is pembrolizumab (Keytruda) Endocrine therapy Endocrine therapy blocks estrogen or progesterone to treat hormone receptorpositive breast cancer The endocrine system is made up of organs and tissues that produce hormones Hormones are natural chemicals released into the bloodstream There are 4 hormones that might be targeted in endocrine therapy: Estrogen is made mainly by the ovaries, and also by other tissues in the body such as the fat tissue Progesterone is made mainly by the ovaries Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) is made by a part of the brain called the hypothalamus It tells the ovaries to make estrogen and progesterone and testicles to make testosterone LHRH is also called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) Androgen is made by the adrenal glands, testicles, and ovaries Hormones may cause breast cancer to grow Endocrine therapy will stop your body from making hormones or it will block what hormones do in the body This can slow tumor growth or shrink the tumor for a period of time Endocrine therapy is sometimes called hormone therapy It is not the same as hormone replacement therapy used for menopause There is one type of surgical endocrine therapy: Bilateral oophorectomy is surgery to remove both ovaries Other main types of endocrine therapy include: Ovarian ablation uses radiation to permanently stop the ovaries from making hormones Ovarian suppression uses drugs to temporarily

completed in less than 30 minutes PET scan A positron emission tomography (PET) scan highlights cells in your body that may be cancerous You may have a PET scan after you\u2019ve been diagnosed to determine the extent of your cancer or to see if it has metastasized PET imaging can also show how well treatment is working A PET scan requires injecting a radioactive substance called a tracer into your bloodstream It takes about an hour for the tracer to circulate throughout your body The tracer targets your cancer cells, which show up as bright spots on the scan Afterward, the radiotracer is passed out of your body in your urine A PET scan appointment can take 1 to 2 hours, including about 30 minutes of actual scanning time Because PET uses a different imaging method, it\u2019s often combined with other types of imaging, such as CT or MRI, to provide an even more PET imaging A positron emission tomography (PET) scan highlights cells in your body that may be cancerous A PET scan can determine the extent of your cancer or see if it has metastasized PET imaging can also show how well treatment is working. detailed image This combined method is called a PET/CT or PET/MRI scan PSMA-PET PET scans use different types of tracers The most common tracer in prostate cancer locates a protein called prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) on the surface of prostate cancer cells Prostate cancer cells can make a lot of PSMA, so doctors developed tracers that target this specific protein Not everyone with prostate cancer will need a PSMA-PET scan It\u2019s mostly used to monitor prostate cancer for recurrence It\u2019s also used to determine whether targeted therapy can treat certain cases of metastatic prostate cancer Bone scan A bone scan can detect whether cancer has spread to your bones A bone scan may be used if you have bone pain, have a high risk for bone metastasis, or have changes in certain test results Bone scans may also be used to monitor treatment A bone scan uses a radioactive tracer to make pictures of the inside of bones Before the pictures are taken, the tracer is injected into your bloodstream It can take a few hours for the tracer to enter your bones A special camera will take pictures of the tracer in your bones Areas of bone damage absorb more tracer than healthy bone These areas show up as bright spots in the scans Ultrasound Ultrasound imaging is commonly used to help guide a biopsy of the prostate This is called transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) imaging During a biopsy, an ultrasound probe is inserted into the rectum The probe is about the size of a finger The device uses highenergy sound waves to create a view of the prostate from inside the body These images allow the surgeon to remove a small sample of the prostate without having to open up your abdomen PET/CT scan of prostate cancer This image combines PET and CT scans to show a cross-section of a patient\u2019s pelvis The greenish circle identifies cancer in the prostate, while the intense red dot indicates cancer that has spread to a lymph node in the pelvis At some centers, your saved MRI images can be combined with real-time ultrasound to provide a

lymphoma In this procedure, a thin, hollow needle is inserted into the brain to remove a sliver of the tumor The sample is sent to a lab to be tested for cancer cells Tests after diagnosis After an MRI scan and a stereotactic biopsy have confirmed a diagnosis of lymphoma in the central nervous system, a few more tests are needed to find out how far the cancer has grown in the CNS and if it may have spread to other areas of the body Although many people with primary CNS lymphoma have only one visible tumor, others have multiple tumors on their scan Testing after diagnosis also checks for signs of cancer in the eyes, cerebrospinal fluid, blood, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and possibly the bone marrow and testicles These tests include: Eye exam Your eyes are connected directly to the brain by the optic nerves So primary CNS lymphoma doesn\u2019t travel far to spread from the brain to the eyes. (Very rarely it starts in the eyes and spreads to the brain.) If lymphoma occurs in the eye, it often forms in the back of the eye, called the retina The retina converts what you see into signals, which it sends through the optic nerves to the brain Lymphoma cells can also invade the vitreous, the clear gel that fills the eye When primary CNS lymphoma involves the eyes, it\u2019s called vitreoretinal lymphoma Everyone diagnosed with primary CNS lymphoma should have a thorough eye exam This is done at an eye doctor\u2019s office using a slit lamp, a microscope with a bright light You\u2019ll first be given drops in your eyes to widen (dilate) your pupils This gives the eye doctor a better view inside your eyes The eye doctor will use the lamp\u2019s bright light to examine the retina, optic nerve, and other parts of your eyes If the vitreous looks unusual or you have visual symptoms, you may need a biopsy of the vitreous For this procedure (called CNS lymphoma in the eye Primary CNS lymphoma can occur in the brain, the spinal cord, and sometimes in the eyes Everyone diagnosed with primary CNS lymphoma should have a thorough eye examination Here, an ophthalmologist uses a special microscope called a slit lamp to take a close-up look at a patient\u2019s eye. a vitrectomy), your eye is first numbed with anesthetic Then a thin needle is inserted into the eye The needle removes a tiny amount of vitreous, which is then tested for cancer cells In some cases, a vitrectomy alone can confirm the diagnosis of primary CNS lymphoma without the need for brain biopsy Lumbar puncture A lumbar puncture (also called a spinal tap) is a procedure that removes a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for testing CSF is a liquid that flows in and around the hollow areas in the brain and spinal cord This fluid protects and nourishes the central nervous system Testing the CSF can help confirm a diagnosis of primary CNS lymphoma Testing also provides other helpful information needed for planning treatment A lumbar puncture is done only if it can be performed safely and it won\u2019t delay treatment If cancer cells are found in the spinal fluid, or if you\u2019re having symptoms, another MRI may be needed to find out if there are any lesions in the spine Lumbar puncture Cancer cells in the spinal fluid may or may not cause symptoms A lumbar puncture is used to learn whether cancer has spread to the spinal cord First, the

the nose (nasal cavity) and opens into the voice box (larynx) and esophagus (the tube that goes to the stomach) The pharynx (said fair-inks) has 3 parts: Nasopharynx Oropharynx Hypopharynx Cancer can be found in any part of the pharynx This book will focus on cancer of the nasopharynx, also called nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) The nasopharynx is a small, tube-shaped structure above the soft part of the back of the mouth (soft palate) that connects the nasal cavity to the oropharynx The nasal cavity is the space inside the nose It lies above the bone that forms the roof of the mouth (hard palate) and curves down at the back to join the throat The oropharynx includes the back of the roof of the mouth (soft palate), the tonsils, the side and back walls of the throat, and the base of the tongue found in the throat The pharynx The pharynx is a hollow, muscular tube inside the neck that starts behind the nose and opens into the larynx and esophagus The pharynx has 3 parts: the

to be treated at a high-volume center or hospital that has experience in their type of cancer Nasopharyngeal cancer Nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) is a rare cancer that most often occurs in people from parts of Asia, Native America, and North Africa Most NPCs start in the squamous cells that form the surface lining of the nasopharynx Normally, these are thin, flat cells and are similar to the top layer of skin and surface lining of some other parts of the body such as the lungs and esophagus Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common type of nasopharyngeal cancer and is the focus of this book Cancer cells form a tumor called a primary tumor within the area of the nasopharynx, the part of the throat connecting the back of the nose (nasal cavity) to the back of the mouth (the pharynx) A tumor can grow into nearby tissue Cancer cells often spread to lymph nodes in the neck, and less frequently to the lungs It's often difficult to recognize nasopharyngeal cancer because the symptoms are similar to other less serious conditions Also, many people with nasopharyngeal cancer don't have any symptoms until the cancer reaches an advanced stage Nasopharyngeal cancer shouldn't be confused

nodes in the neck, further imaging with CT or MRI is recommended A substance called contrast is used to make the pictures clearer Biopsy A biopsy removes samples of fluid or tissue from the body to be tested Your doctor will consider the nodule size and other features as seen on the ultrasound to determine if a biopsy is needed Some nodules don't need to be biopsied and are monitored with

cells to diagnose disease By examining the sample under a microscope, the pathologist is able to determine whether the nodule is cancerous, and if so, the cancer type In certain types of lesions, such as follicular and oncocytic tumors, fine-needle biopsy can identify the nature of the cells, but can't determine if the nodule is cancerous For these lesions, surgery is often needed to make a final diagnosis Now, molecular tests are available that can help determine whether the nodule is cancerous and whether surgery is necessary Papillary carcinoma is the most common type of thyroid cancer,

basics The breast Breast cancer starts in the cells of the breast Regular screening and breast exams help find breast cancer at its earliest, most treatable stages The breast The breast is an organ and a gland found on the chest The breast is made of milk ducts, fat, nerves, lymph and blood vessels, ligaments, and other connective tissue Behind the breast is the pectoral muscle and ribs Muscle and ligaments help hold the breast in place Breast tissue contains glands that can make milk These milk glands are called lobules Lobules look like tiny clusters of grapes Small tubes called ducts connect the lobules to the nipple to carry breast milk The ring of darker breast skin is called the areola The raised tip within the areola is called the nipple The nipple-areola complex is a term that refers to both parts Lymph is a clear fluid that gives cells water and food It also helps to fight germs or tumor cells Lymph drains from breast tissue into lymph vessels and travels to lymph nodes near your armpit (axilla) Nodes near the armpit are called axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) The breast The breast is a glandular organ made up of milk ducts, fat, nerves, blood and lymph vessels, ligaments, and other connective tissue Breast cancer Breast cancer starts in the cells of the breast Almost all breast cancers are carcinomas Carcinomas are cancers that start in the cells that line the inner or outer surfaces of the body There are different types of breast carcinoma The most common types are either ductal or lobular Ductal carcinoma starts in the cells that line the milk ducts Ductal carcinoma is the most common type of breast cancer Lobular carcinoma starts in the lobules (milk glands) of the breast Anyone can develop breast cancer, including those assigned male at birth Although there are some differences between those assigned male and those assigned female at birth, treatment is very similar for all genders If you are looking for more information on breast cancer,

esophagus and stomach Barrett esophagus In Barrett esophagus (BE), the squamous cells that line the lower part of the esophagus have changed or been replaced with abnormal cells as a result of chronic reflux Those with Barrett esophagus are at risk of developing adenocarcinoma of the esophagus How cancer spreads Esophageal cancer usually starts in the innermost layer (mucosa) and grows outward through and along the layers of the esophagus wall Cancer can spread to nearby lymph nodes, veins, arteries, and organs such as the liver, pancreas, lung, and spleen It might also grow into nearby lymphatic or blood vessels, and from there spread to nearby lymph nodes or to other parts of the body Through your cancer care, you might find measurements using the metric system (centimeters, millimeters, etc.) That is because your care team uses the metric system to measure many aspects of treatment Esophageal cancers tend to develop slowly over many years Before cancer develops, precancerous changes often occur in the inner lining (mucosa) of the esophagus Since these early changes rarely cause symptoms, they often go undetected Stages of esophageal cancer can be grouped into 3 main categories, depending on how far the cancer has spread Early-stage cancer has not grown beyond the inside of the esophagus The tumor may be very small (2 centimeters or less, which is about the size of a peanut) and is not in any lymph nodes Locoregional or locally advanced cancer has invaded the esophagus wall and/or spread to the lymph nodes or organs near or in direct contact with the esophagus Metastatic cancer has spread to other parts of the body The most common metastatic sites are the liver, distant lymph nodes, lung, bone, and brain Key points Most esophageal cancers start in cells that line the inside of the esophagus and secrete mucus These esophageal cancers are called adenocarcinomas Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma starts in the thin, flat cells found in the inner lining of the esophagus The esophagus wall is made up of 4 main layers: mucosa, submucosa, muscularis propria, and tunica adventitia Esophageal cancers tend to develop slowly over many years Before cancer develops, pre-cancerous changes often occur in the inner lining (mucosa) of the esophagus Early-stage esophageal cancer is contained in the esophagus The tumor is often small and is not in any lymph nodes Locoregional or locally advanced esophageal cancer has invaded other layers of the esophagus wall and/or spread to the lymph nodes or organs near or in direct contact with the esophagus Cancer can spread to distant parts of the body through the blood or lymphatic system This is called metastatic esophageal cancer Distant metastases could be in the liver, distant lymph nodes, and lung. 2 Diagnosing esophageal cancer Test results General health tests Nutritional assessment Blood tests Imaging tests Endoscopy procedures Biopsy Biomarker testing Genetic risk testing Performance

made up of tissues and organs that produce hormones Hormones are chemical substances that are made in one part of the body and are carried through the bloodstream to other parts of the body where they help control how organs or cells work Adrenal tumors are tumors that can be found in the adrenal glands in one or both adrenal glands Most tumors found on the adrenal glands are benign (not cancer) Adrenal cancer is a rare cancer that starts in one or both of the adrenal glands Adrenal cancer, also called adrenocortical cancer (ACC), can occur at any age But it\u2019s most likely to affect children ages 5 and under, and adults in their 40s and 50s Half of those with adrenal cancer will have symptoms caused by hormones from the tumor Others may experience symptoms if the tumor has grown so large that it is pressing on nearby organs There are no known causes for most adrenal tumors However, hereditary conditions have been linked to an increased risk of developing an adrenal tumor. 2

difficulty or pain swallowing, loss of your voice, or pain or stiffness in your neck It may also be helpful if the cancer has spread to another organ, such as the bones or brain, to stop the cancer from growing in that specific area You will first have a planning session called a simulation You will be placed in the treatment position and a CT scan or other type of scan will be done The images will be used to make a radiation plan tailored to your body and cancer During radiation treatment, you will lie on a table in the same position as during simulation A technician will operate the machine from a nearby room, but will be able to see, hear, and speak with you at all times You won't feel anything while the radiation is being delivered One treatment session can take 30 to 60

They\u2019re also used to check and monitor prostate cancer in patients who have been diagnosed Two common tests that look for prostate cancer are the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test and digital rectal exam PSA test This is a blood test that measures the amount of PSA in your bloodstream PSA is a protein made inside the prostate gland Its job is to help semen transport sperm All prostate cells, both normal cells and cancer cells, make PSA If there\u2019s something wrong with the prostate\u2014 like prostate cancer\u2014the prostate may make more PSA While most PSA goes into semen, a little bit ends up in the bloodstream, too An unusually high amount of PSA in the blood may be a sign of prostate cancer Likewise, an increase in PSA after treatment may indicate that the treatment is losing effectiveness However, age and other factors\u2014such as an enlarged prostate or a urinary tract infection\u2014 can also cause high levels of PSA This means that a PSA test by itself can\u2019t provide a diagnosis of prostate cancer That\u2019s why a PSA test is often paired with imaging or a digital rectal exam, or both, to decide whether you need a biopsy PSA level (also called total PSA) is measured in nanograms of PSA per milliliter (ng/mL) of blood PSA testing Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a protein made inside the prostate gland If there\u2019s something wrong with the prostate, the prostate may make more PSA An unusually high amount of PSA in the blood may be a sign of prostate cancer But a high PSA level doesn\u2019t automatically mean you have prostate cancer Rather, it\u2019s a warning sign that you may need further testing Digital rectal exam Don\u2019t be fooled by the name\u2014no high-tech electronics are used in a digital rectal exam For this test, the word \u201cdigital\u201d means \u201cfinger.\u201d The doctor will insert a finger into your rectum to feel your prostate for any signs of cancer The doctor will wear gloves and use a lubricant to make it easier A digital rectal exam (also called a prostate exam) may be an awkward and unpleasant form of testing But it\u2019s the simplest and most direct way to check the size and texture of your prostate An irregular or hardened part of the prostate could be a sign of a tumor Not all parts of the prostate can be felt during a digital rectal exam, though So it\u2019s usually paired with a PSA test and other factors\u2014 your age, race, family history, and more\u2014to determine whether you need further testing Don\u2019t fear the digital rectal exam A digital rectal exam is the simplest

include: Mitomycin and capecitabine Mitomycin and 5-FU 5-FU and cisplatin While you undergo chemotherapy with one of the above regimens, you will also receive treatment with radiation therapy 5 days per week These chemotherapy regimens are described in more detail next Mitomycin and capecitabine is a commonly used regimen Capecitabine is taken by mouth twice daily, Monday through Friday (on radiation days only), for 5 and a half to 6 weeks You will be undergoing radiation therapy during the same time period On the day you begin taking capecitabine, a single intravenous dose of mitomycin will be given Another dose of mitomycin is usually given at the start of week Mitomycin and 5-FU is another regimen recommended for use with radiation therapy. 5-FU is given by continuous (constant) infusion over several days You do not need to stay at a treatment center during this time, however Before chemotherapy begins, a thin, flexible tube will be inserted into a vein in your upper chest, below the collarbone This is referred to as a \u201cport.\u201d Using a small wire and often x-ray guidance, the tube is guided to a large vein above the right side of the heart Some people receive a temporary PICC line instead A PICC line is a deep IV that stays in the arm for the duration of treatment The 5-FU is stored in a small, wearable pump connected to the catheter The pump infuses the medicine into the body very slowly, over several days The tube, called a central venous catheter, stays in place for the duration of treatment It allows you to receive chemotherapy with 5-FU from home The first 5-FU infusion starts when radiation therapy begins and lasts for 4 to 5 days You will have another 4- to 5-day infusion at the start of week 5 of radiation therapy The pump will be disconnected and removed between infusions A single dose of mitomycin is given on the first day of the first 5-FU infusion Another dose of mitomycin may be given when the second 5-FU infusion begins, towards the end of radiation therapy Another option for chemotherapy is 5-FU and cisplatin. 5-FU is given as described above Cisplatin is given intravenously on the first day of 5-FU infusions Chemotherapy can kill normal, healthy cells in addition to cancer cells The damage to healthy cells causes potentially harsh side effects The most common side effects of the chemotherapy regimens discussed above are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sores in the mouth and lining of the anus, and low blood cell counts Low white blood cell counts can make you prone to infections Talk to your treatment team about ways to prevent or lessen these side effects Capecitabine can cause a side effect known as hand-foot syndrome Symptoms include redness, swelling, and pain on the palms of the hands, bottoms of feet, or both Sometimes blisters appear Your dose of capecitabine may be changed at the earliest signs of hand-foot syndrome Next steps See Follow-up and surveillance on page 23 for next steps We

spread beyond the pelvis See page 26 for information on metastatic anal cancer Like anal canal cancer, most perianal cancers are treated with chemoradiation However, local excision (surgery) may be an option for some early-stage, low-risk perianal cancers Local excision involves removing only the tumor and a small area of surrounding tissue Local excision Local excision is a recommended treatment option for some stage I and stage IIA perianal cancers Stage I and II anal cancers have not invaded nearby lymph nodes See page 13 for more information on cancer staging For local excision to be an option, the cancer must not have invaded the sphincter muscle The cancer grade is also important when determining if local excision is an option The cancer grade is a rating of how fast the cancer is expected to grow and spread It is based on how abnormal the cancer cells look when viewed under a microscope", "extracted_entities": ["anal cancer", "stage I", "stage II", "stage III", "Mitomycin",

important to you may not be important to someone else Some things that may play a role in your decision-making: What you want and how that might differ from what others want Your religious and spiritual beliefs Your feelings about certain treatments like surgery or chemotherapy Your feelings about pain or side effects such as nausea and vomiting Cost of treatment, travel to treatment centers, and time away from work Quality of life and length of life How active you are and the activities that are important to you Think about what you want from treatment Discuss openly the risks

through the anus may be an option This is called transanal local excision The surgeon cuts through all layers of the rectal wall to remove the cancer and some surrounding normal rectal tissue Lymph nodes are not removed Advanced techniques for removing tumors higher in the rectum include transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) and transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) If surgery confirms that the cancer is T1 and the tumor is considered low risk, no further treatment is needed Surveillance will begin Surveillance after transanal local excision Proctoscopies and imaging are recommended for 5 years after transanal local excision These will take place every 3 to 6 months for the first 2 years, then every 6 months the next 3 years For the imaging, either endorectal ultrasound or MRI with contrast is recommended A colonoscopy is recommended 1 year after surgery If the results are good, your next colonoscopy will take place in 3 years After that, a colonoscopy is recommended every 5 years Other local excision results Sometimes more treatment is needed after local excision Reasons you may need more treatment include: Testing of the removed tissues finds high risk features The tumor is larger than expected and has invaded the muscle layer (a T2 tumor) In either case, the preferred next treatment is transabdominal surgery See the next page for more information on this method A second option is chemotherapy combined with radiation Doctors call this chemoradiation This treatment approach is normally used for locally advanced cancers See page 23 for more information If chemoradiation works well, you might have chemotherapy next to kill any lingering cancer cells Or, you and your doctor may agree to watch and wait If there are signs of cancer after chemoradiation, transabdominal resection is recommended Chemotherapy may follow Transabdominal surgery Transabdominal surgery is recommended for tumors that have invaded the muscle layer of the rectal wall In staging terms, these are T2 tumors Abdominal surgery is also a recommended option for: smaller (T1) tumors, and some larger (T3) cancers that haven't spread to lymph nodes This method involves cutting into the abdomen to reach and remove the rectal tumor, some surrounding healthy tissue, and nearby lymph nodes A pathologist examines the removed tissue and determines the cancer stage The type of transabdominal surgery performed depends on the location of the tumor and the extent of the cancer At least 12 lymph nodes should be removed during all types of transabdominal surgery Low anterior resection A low anterior resection (LAR) is a type of transabdominal surgery used for tumors in the mid to upper rectum In addition to the rectal tumor, part or all of the last section of the colon is removed When possible, the colon is connected to the remaining rectum This is called a colorectal anastomosis (reconnection) Otherwise the colon may be attached directly to the anus This is called a coloanal anastomosis This Low anterior resection (LAR) LAR is a type of abdominal surgery used to remove tumors in the mid to upper rectum The rectal tumor and part or all of the sigmoid colon is removed When possible, the colon is connected to the remaining rectum. allows for the possibility of having near-normal bowel movements Your surgeon is likely to delay reattaching the bowel in order to let the surgical site heal In this case, or if the colon can't be connected to the anus, a colostomy is made A colostomy connects a part of the colon to the outside of the abdomen This creates an opening (a stoma) on the surface of the abdomen Stool exits the body through the stoma and goes into a bag attached to the skin A colostomy may only be needed for a short time to allow the rectum to heal before being reconnected to the colon But sometimes it is needed permanently Abdominoperineal resection This type of transabdominal surgery is used for tumors in the lower rectum These tumors may have grown into the anus or nearby pelvic floor muscle (levator ani) Abdominoperineal resection (APR) typically involves removing the anus, the rectum, the area where the rectum and colon meet, and other tissue In some cases, the levator muscles are also removed The outer ring of muscle in the anus may be spared A permanent colostomy is always needed Abdominoperineal resection (APR) APR is used

Depending on the type of surgery you have (if any), you may have annual Pap screening tests after treatment Pap testing is helpful for finding new areas of abnormal and/or precancerous cells It is not as good at detecting recurrent cervical cancer Pap testing is also known as cervical or vaginal cytology Blood tests If you have symptoms, or a physical exam was suspicious for recurrence, your doctor may order blood tests In addition to a complete blood count (CBC), testing may measure blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels These check your kidney function Liver function tests may also be ordered Survivorship In addition to surveillance testing, a range of other care is important for cancer survivors This includes keeping alert for symptoms of cancer recurrence See Part 6: Survivorship for more information Recurrence This section discusses cervical cancer that does not improve with treatment (persistent) or that returns after treatment (recurrent) If your doctor suspects recurrence based on your symptoms or a physical exam, you will have imaging tests to check This could include CT, PET, and/or MRI Surgery to look inside the body (exploratory surgery) may be helpful in some cases The goal is to learn the extent of the cancer This can help guide treatment decisions Biomarker testing Biomarkers are features of a cancer that can help guide treatment Biomarkers are often mutations (changes) in particular genes They can also be proteins that are made in response to the cancer Biomarker testing is recommended for all recurrent cervical cancers The results help determine whether treatment with certain targeted therapies is an option The results can also be used to determine whether you can join certain clinical trials Some doctors order biomarker testing early in the course of treatment Many doctors wait and order it only if the cancer returns or spreads Testing should be performed on tumor tissue removed during a biopsy or surgery when possible Otherwise, a sample of blood may be tested instead Other names for this testing include molecular testing, tumor profiling, genomic testing, tumor gene testing, nextgeneration sequencing (NGS), mutation testing, and comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) Testing for PD-L1 expression is recommended for everyone with recurrent, progressive, or metastatic cervical cancer If the PD-L1 level exceeds a set cutoff point, the cancer is considered PD-L1-positive If needed, treatment with certain targeted therapies or immunotherapies may be an option for PD-L1\u2013positive tumors The biomarkers listed below are less common in cervical cancer but should still be tested for Mismatch repair (MMR) Microsatellite instability (MSI) Tumor mutational burden (TMB) NTRK gene fusion (for those with a cervical sarcoma) HER2 RET gene fusion If cancer returns to the pelvis Cervical cancer that returns to the pelvis only is known as a local or regional recurrence If the area has not been treated with radiation and the cancer can be surgically removed, this is generally preferred After surgery, EBRT and systemic therapy are recommended Brachytherapy may also be given If the area has already been treated with radiation and it is no longer an option, possible treatment options are listed below The best option(s) for you will depend on the specific location of the new cancer growth in the pelvis Pelvic exenteration surgery Radical hysterectomy Brachytherapy Individualized EBRT and possibly systemic therapy Systemic therapy Resection of new cancer growth Radical hysterectomy and brachytherapy are typically only considered in carefully selected patients Supportive care is always an option, whether you are in active treatment or not Pelvic exenteration Pelvic exenteration is a radical surgery that involves removing multiple organs from the pelvis The goal is to cure the cancer by removing all of the organs to which cancer has or may spread All remaining organs of the female reproductive system are removed during pelvic exenteration This includes the uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and vagina Nearby organs in the pelvis including the bladder, rectum, and/or anus may also be removed If the bladder and/or organs involved in bowel function are removed, a diversion is typically performed Diversions are surgical procedures that divert (redirect) urine and/or stool to new openings

pancreatic cancer Multidisciplinary consult Imaging Endoscopic tests Biopsy Blood tests Genetic tests for inherited mutations Biomarker tests for profiling Key points A series of tests is needed to identify pancreatic cancer and make a treatment plan Imaging is key to staging the cancer and deciding if surgery is a treatment option Testing can also show if the cancer has unique features for which there is specific treatment Multidisciplinary consult There is no tell-tale sign of pancreatic cancer, especially in early stages Signs of pancreatic cancer may also be caused by other health conditions Health care providers may suspect pancreatic cancer based on symptoms, such as yellowed skin or eyes called jaundice Signs of pancreatic cancer on x-rays include widerthan-normal pancreatic

There are other, less common cancers that can arise in the kidney While they can sometimes be confused with RCC, it is important to note that they are treated differently Urothelial carcinoma starts in the cells that line the renal pelvis and ureter that drain the kidney While these tumors can be found up the ureter near the kidneys, they are not kidney tumors These tumors share many features with bladder cancer These tumors used to be called transitional call cancer For more information, see NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Bladder Cancer, available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app Wilms tumor (nephroblastoma) usually occurs in young children In Wilms tumor (WT), cancer cells are found in the kidney Renal sarcoma starts in the blood vessels or connective tissue of the kidney For more information, see NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Soft Tissue Sarcoma, available at NCCN. org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app RCC subtypes Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer RCC can be broken down into subtypes by looking at the cancer cells under a microscope This is called histology Tumor histology and other factors are an important part of choosing a treatment plan Ask your care team about your cancer subtype Clear cell RCC Clear cell RCC (ccRCC) is the most common subtype It occurs in about 7 out of 10 people with RCC Under a microscope, clear cells look very pale or clear Non-clear cell RCC Non-clear cell RCC is also called nccRCC There are several subtypes Papillary RCC is the most common subtype of nccRCC (about 1 out of 10 people with RCC) Most papillary tumors look like long, thin finger-like growths under a microscope It is also called PRCC Chromophobe RCC cells are pale, but larger than clear cells, and look different. descent who carry the sickle cell trait, sickle cell disease, or other diseases that can cause sickling of the red blood cells Translocation RCC can be found at all ages but tends to be diagnosed in children or younger adults These tumors have unique fusions of genes that promote the cancer Unclassified RCC describes cancer cells that don\u2019t look like any of the subtypes or more than one subtype is present Rare types of nccRCC Other rare types of nccRCC include the following: Collecting duct RCC (cdRCC) forms in the cells of the collecting ducts or tubules Renal medullary carcinoma (RMC) can be found in young people of African Some other RCC types that have been defined recently include: Clear cell papillary renal cell tumor Fumarate hydratase-deficient RCC ELOC (formerly TCEB1)-mutated RCC Renal cell carcinoma Most kidney cancers arise in cells that line the small tubes in the kidney called renal tubules Sarcomatoid features Almost any type of renal cell carcinoma can become sarcomatoid (sRCC) or have sarcomatoid features This means that the cells of the cancer look like the cells of a sarcoma (cancer of the connective tissues, such as muscles, nerves, fat, blood vessels, and fibrous tissue) Sarcomatoid renal cancers occur in less than of RCC tumors but when present tend to grow more quickly than other types of kidney cancer and are more likely to spread to other parts of the body This makes them more difficult to treat How kidney cancer spreads Tumors can grow in any part of the kidney and can grow into the renal vein and vena cava Kidney cancer can also spread to other parts of the body in a process called metastasis In metastasis, cancer cells travel through your blood or lymph to form new tumors outside of the kidney The new tumors are called metastatic tumors or metastases Local spread \u2013 In locally advanced disease, cancer has spread to a nearby area close to the primary tumor Kidney cancer can invade nearby tissues like surrounding fat, blood vessels, lymph nodes, adrenal glands, and Gerota\u2019s fascia Distant metastasis \u2013 In metastatic disease, cancer has spread to distant parts of the body far from the primary site Kidney cancer tends to spread to distant sites such as the lungs, lymph nodes, and bones, and less frequently to the liver and brain

breast cancer early Breast cancer found earlier is treated more successfully, reducing the risk of dying from breast cancer This book will cover screening recommendations for those assigned female at birth It will also discuss screening and testing options for those who are pregnant or lactating (breastfeeding), and those with breast pain, nipple discharge, changes in the skin, lumps, or other symptoms that require further testing Transgender individuals Due to lack of evidence, this book does not provide screening guidance for transgender individuals Transgender individuals should consult with their primary care physician to determine when/whether screening would be appropriate Those assigned male at birth Those assigned male at birth do not undergo regular mammogram screening However, if you have breast pain or redness, or a change in the size and shape of one breast, then see your health care provider and read about recommended tests in Chapter Health care providers During regular health checkups and breast cancer screening, you might come in contact with the following health care providers (HCPs): Breast specialist is an expert in breast health and disease Breast diagnostic radiologist interprets the results of mammograms, MRIs, and other imaging tests, and performs needle biopsies as needed Gynecologist diagnoses and treats diseases of the female reproductive organs Lactation consultant specializes in breastfeeding Mammogram, MRI, and ultrasound technologists operate the mammogram unit, or MRI or ultrasound machine Advanced practice providers are nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and certified nurse midwives who can help prevent, evaluate, examine, and diagnose human disease, including breast cancer Obstetrician specializes in pregnancy and in childbirth Pathologist analyzes the cells, tissues, and organs removed during a biopsy or surgery. \u2022 Primary care provider (PCP) or physician gives a wide range of care, including prevention and treatment Key points Anyone can develop breast cancer, but breast cancer occurs much more frequently in persons assigned female at birth Inside breasts are lobules, ducts, fat, blood and lymph vessels, ligaments, and connective tissue Lobules are structures that make breast milk Ducts carry breast milk from the lobules to the nipple Breast cancer often starts in the ducts or lobules and then spreads into the surrounding tissue Breast cancer screening aims to find cancer early and before symptoms start Breast cancer found earlier can be treated more successfully Breast cancer screening saves lives by detecting cancer earlier, when it can be treated more successfully When I first discovered the small hard pebble under the skin of my chest wall, I felt sort of silly asking

cancer basics The breast Breast cancer Inflammatory breast cancer Key points Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare, aggressive cancer where cancer cells block lymph vessels in the skin of the breast This causes the breast to look red and swollen and feel warm to the touch The breast The breast is an organ and a gland found on the chest The breast is made of milk ducts, fat, nerves, lymph and blood vessels, ligaments, and other connective tissue Behind the breast is the pectoral (chest) muscle and ribs Muscle and ligaments help hold the breast in place Breast tissue contains glands that can make milk These milk glands are called lobules Lobules look like tiny clusters of grapes Small tubes called ducts connect the lobules to the nipple The ring of darker breast skin is called the areola The raised tip within the areola is called the nipple The nipple-areola complex (NAC) is a term that refers to both parts Lymph is a clear fluid that gives cells water and food It also helps to fight germs Lymph drains from breast tissue into lymph vessels and travels to lymph nodes near your armpit (axilla) Nodes near the armpit are called axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) of the Breast Invasive ductal carcinoma Most inflammatory breast cancers are invasive ductal carcinomas This means that cancer started in the cells that line the milk ducts and

not normal Cancer cells show up as bright spots on PET scans Not all bright spots are cancer When a PET scan is combined with CT, it is called a PET/CT scan Confirmed CSCC Once a diagnosis of CSCC is made, your doctor will follow up with: A complete head-to-toe skin exam to look for other lesions An exam of the lymph nodes Cancer cells can travel through blood and a fluid called lymph to form tumors in other parts of the body Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped structures that are part of the body's immune system Lymph nodes filter substances that travel through the lymphatic fluid They contain lymphocytes (white blood cells) that help the body fight infection and disease If your lymph nodes feel larger than they should be, cancer may have spread to the lymph nodes (this is also called \u201cnodal disease\u201d) To find out, your doctor will use a needle biopsy to take a sample from the lymph node for testing Squamous cell skin cancer that has not spread to nearby lymph nodes is referred to as \u201clocal\u201d squamous cell skin cancer. \uf0dc See Part 3 for more information on local CSCC If cancer is found in the lymph nodes, it is called \u201cregional\u201d squamous

over many years. h An actinic keratosis is an area of scaly or rough skin that has a higher chance of becoming squamous cell skin cancer You may be more likely to get squamous cell skin cancer if you have actinic keratoses, a weakened immune system, or certain genetic syndromes Squamous cell skin cancer can form in old wounds, burns, or scars This is called Marjolin\u2019s ulcer and it can be harder to treat Testing for CSCC could include a full health history, an examination of any lesions, and a skin biopsy to remove a sample and test it for cancer Imaging scans will also be done if cancer goes deeper into the skin or has spread to other parts of the body Cancer cells can travel through blood and lymph fluid to form tumors in other parts of the body If spread to lymph nodes is suspected, your doctor will do a lymph node biopsy. 2 Types of treatments Who is on my care team Superficial treatments Surgery Radiation therapy Systemic therapy Clinical trials Key points This

personal preferences Not everyone will receive the same treatment Who is on my care team After being diagnosed with squamous cell skin cancer, knowing what to do next can be confusing Aside from your oncologist (your cancer doctor), there are others who may be involved in your cancer care Some members of your care team will be with you throughout your treatment, while others will only be there for parts of it Get to know your care team and let them get to know you Depending on your diagnosis, your care team might include the following: Dermatologists are doctors who diagnose and treat skin conditions, including skin cancer They also do skin exams and can teach you how to do them on your own Mohs surgeons are doctors (usually dermatologists) who have advanced training in Mohs surgery and reconstruction after surgery They remove the tumor, ensure no more cancer can be seen using a microscope, and can restore the appearance of the affected area with reconstructive surgery Surgical oncologists are doctors who are trained to diagnose and surgically treat and remove cancerous tumors, including those that have spread beyond the skin Medical oncologists are doctors who specialize in

wrong But they don\u2019t provide enough information to identify a specific illness Different tests, physical exams, and surgical procedures are required to diagnose a glioma If these tests show that you have a glioma, your care team will discuss your treatment options with you If possible, seek care at a center with experience in treating brain tumors Diagnosis vs. prognosis What\u2019s the difference between your diagnosis and your prognosis These two words sound alike but they\u2019re very different Diagnosis: The identification of an illness based on tests The diagnosis names what illness you have Prognosis: The likely course and outcome of a disease The prognosis predicts how your disease will turn out Can gliomas be cured Most gliomas are not curable, but they are usually treatable Treatment can slow down the tumor\u2019s growth for a period of time, reduce its symptoms, and prolong life The main treatments for a glioma are surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy These are often combined with one another for more complete treatment Another option to consider is participating in a clinical trial for a potential new treatment Treatment may be able to stop the glioma from growing and keep it stabilized for a time This may last for months or years However, even with the best treatment, gliomas usually grow back eventually So periodic follow-up visits and additional rounds of treatment are recommended It\u2019s true that gliomas are eventually fatal for most patients Many people diagnosed with a glioma have a difficult road ahead Still, there\u2019s hope New therapies designed to treat specific types of gliomas are currently being studied in clinical trials The number of these trials has increased in recent years, offering more hope to people living with this disease Also, be aware that survival statistics come from research done several (or many) years ago Those statistics may not reflect the improvements offered by today\u2019s

caregivers and loved ones This book is for you, too This book will help you understand this disease and the challenges it presents People with tumors in the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) commonly develop problems with brain function This can show itself in multiple ways, such as slower thinking, memory loss, difficulty moving or walking, trouble speaking, inability to do everyday activities, changes in behavior, losing one\u2019s sense of self, and other problems Helping a person with a brain tumor can be challenging and time-consuming You may be providing physical, mental, emotional, and hands-on support You may be taking the patient to appointments, helping to lessen side effects, and even assisting with treatment decisions Gather as much help as you can Start with the online resources listed in the back of this book Key points h Gliomas develop from brain cells called glial cells Glial cells support the function of nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord Gliomas can disrupt the brain\u2019s ability to function properly Gliomas can be difficult to treat because they frequently invade and blend into the normal parts of the brain What causes gliomas is unknown What is known is that gliomas often start with an abnormality (mutation) that makes glial cells grow out of control The 3 most common types of glioma tumors are astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, and glioblastomas. h Several different tests and procedures are usually needed to diagnose a glioma Gliomas can be treated but usually return at some point. 66 Don\u2019t Google

specialize in fertility Although natural pregnancy will not be possible, options to discuss may include ovarian transposition, egg or embryo freezing, and consideration of possible surrogate pregnancy in the future Ovarian transposition Cervical cancer treatment may involve external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) Radiation damages the ovaries and causes them to stop producing hormones needed for natural pregnancy Ovarian transposition is a surgery that moves one or both ovaries out of the range of the radiation beam The medical name for this procedure is oophoropexy Ovarian transposition before starting EBRT may be an option if you are premenopausal and have the most common type of cervical cancer, squamous cell carcinoma Egg freezing Unfertilized eggs can be removed, frozen, and stored for later use The medical term for this is oocyte preservation Surrogacy If you have frozen embryos or frozen eggs (oocytes), you may consider using a surrogate A surrogate (often a relative or friend) volunteers to have the embryos inserted into their uterus They carry the pregnancy and give birth For more information on fertility preservation, see the NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app Other testing and care Checking the bladder and bowel Your doctor may want to examine nearby organs, like the bladder and bowel, for signs of cancer If these tests are needed, expect to receive general anesthesia This means you will be fully sedated and unaware that the procedure is taking place These are referred to as examinations under anesthesia (EUAs) Cystoscopy is a procedure to see inside the bladder and other organs of the urinary tract It is performed using a hollow tool with a magnifying lens at one end, called a cystoscope The cystoscope is inserted through the urethra and guided into the bladder Proctoscopy is a procedure to see inside the anus and rectum It is performed with a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and magnifying lens called a proctoscope If abnormal or suspicious areas are seen during cystoscopy or proctoscopy, tissue samples will be removed and tested (biopsied) If you smoke or vape, seek help to quit If you smoke or vape, it\u2019s important to quit Smoking can limit how well cancer treatment works Smoking and vaping can also increase the risk of lung problems during and after chemotherapy They also increase your chances of developing other cancers Nicotine is the chemical in tobacco that makes you want to keep smoking

the cancer in the FIGO system: The size or extent/depth of the tumor Whether any lymph nodes have cancer Whether the cancer has spread to involve nearby organs such as the bladder or rectum Whether the cancer has spread to distant organs such as the liver, lungs, and/or bone (metastasized) The stages are explained and pictured on the following pages In general, people with earlier cancer stages have better outcomes, but not always Some people will do better than expected for their stage, and some will do worse Stage 1A cervical cancer The cancer is 5 millimeters (mm) or smaller. 5 mm is

your doctors to decide whether surgery can be the first treatment, or if chemotherapy is needed first This minimally invasive procedure involves making a tiny cut in the abdomen A thin tube with a light and a camera (laparoscope) is used to view the lining of the abdomen and the surface of organs in the abdomen Tissue samples are taken and tested for cancer cells in a lab Biopsy To diagnose ovarian cancer, a sample of tissue must be removed from your body for testing This is called a biopsy The biopsy is usually done during initial surgery to remove the cancer But sometimes a biopsy is done to diagnose ovarian cancer before surgery or other planned treatment This may be the case if the cancer has spread too much to be removed by surgery initially and chemotherapy is needed first In such cases, a fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy, core biopsy, or paracentesis may be used FNA uses a very thin needle to remove a small sample of tissue from the tumor A core biopsy removes tissue samples with a hollow needle For paracentesis, a long, thin needle is inserted through the skin of the belly to remove a sample of fluid The biopsy samples are sent to a pathologist for testing A pathologist is a doctor who is an expert in testing cells to find disease The pathologist views the samples with a microscope to look for cancer cells If the cells are cancerous, the pathologist notes their appearance and other features Prior surgery or biopsy The cancer may have been found during a surgery or biopsy performed by another doctor In this case, your treatment team will need to review the prior surgery and testing results A pathologist will examine the tumor tissue with a microscope to make sure it is ovarian cancer Your doctors will also want to know if any cancer was left in your body after surgery Family history and genetic testing Ovarian cancer usually occurs for unknown reasons However, about 1 in 6 ovarian cancers is caused by mutations (changes) in genes that are passed down from parent to child This is called hereditary ovarian cancer It is most often caused by mutations in either breast cancer gene 1 (BRCA1) or breast cancer gene 2 (BRCA2) Everyone has BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes When working properly, they are helpful and repair damaged cells But mutations in these genes increase the risk of developing ovarian, breast, and some other cancers Another cause of hereditary ovarian cancer is Lynch syndrome Lynch syndrome is the most common cause of hereditary colon and uterine cancers but can also cause ovarian and other cancers Ovarian cancer associated with a BRCA mutation or Lynch syndrome usually starts at a younger age than non-hereditary ovarian cancer Using your age, health history, and family history, your doctor will assess how likely you are to have hereditary ovarian cancer Genetic testing can tell if you have a mutation in the BRCA genes, or in other genes that play a role in hereditary cancer It is recommended for everyone diagnosed with ovarian cancer If initial treatment works well, BRCA status (whether you have a BRCA mutation) plays an important role in guiding decisions about maintenance therapy Genetic testing may be done through your gynecology or oncology care team, or by a genetic counselor The testing is done on normal tissue\u2013either blood, saliva, or a cheek swab Those with a positive genetic test or who have a strong cancer family history should see a health expert This is typically a genetic counselor A genetic counselor has special training to help patients understand changes in genes that are related to disease There are many other hereditary syndromes besides BRCA and Lynch Genetic testing typically tests for all of them Commercial genetic tests currently available over the counter look for the most common gene mutations, but aren't comprehensive In addition to testing for germline (inherited) BRCA mutations, the tumor itself should be tested for mutations in the BRCA and related genes These are known as somatic or tumor mutations Genetic testing is recommended for everyone diagnosed with ovarian cancer It can determine if you have a mutation in the BRCA genes, or in other genes that play

not spread to nearby lymph nodes is known as \u201clocal\u201d Local disease is usually treated with surgery The goal of treatment is to remove all of the cancer with as little damage to the surrounding skin as possible Risk assessment After squamous cell skin cancer is confirmed, your doctor will consider several features of the cancer to determine if it is a low-, high-, or very high-risk skin cancer This is important to know because high- or very high-risk disease is treated differently than low-risk disease A high-risk CSCC has an increased risk of local recurrence A very high-risk CSCC has an increased risk of local recurrence and of metastasis (spread) The risk level or category for skin cancer is usually based on the highest risk factor found The following factors are used to determine your risk level Location and size Squamous cell skin cancer on the head or neck is more likely to return after treatment than tumors on the trunk, arms, or legs The following tumors are considered high risk because of their location and/or size: Tumors on the trunk, arms, or legs that are between 2 centimeters (cm) (about the size of a nickel) and 4 cm (about the size of a quarter) Any size tumor on the head, face, neck, hands, feet, shins, or sex organs The following tumors are considered very high risk because of their size: h Any tumor over 4 cm in any location Get to know your care team Keep the names and contact information for each member of your care team on hand, so you know whom to contact with questions or concerns Tumor shape If the clinical extent (border) of the tumor is well-defined, it is considered low risk If the border isn\u2019t well-defined and has an uneven shape, it is considered high risk Tumor return after treatment Recurrent tumors are cancer that has returned after treatment, usually after a period of time during which the cancer could not be detected All treatment types have a risk of recurrence The cancer may come back to the same place as the original (primary) tumor or to another place in the body Any tumor that has returned after treatment is considered a high-risk squamous cell skin cancer Tumor formed in damaged skin If squamous cell skin cancer starts in an area that was previously treated with radiation therapy, it is considered a high-risk cancer This is also the case if the cancer starts in a wound, a scar, or an area of damaged or inflamed skin Nerve damage If the tumor has grown into a nerve or group of nerves, usually seen under a microscope, it is considered a high-risk or very high-risk cancer This is

cells Hematopoietic means \u201cblood-forming.\u201d Blood-forming stem cells are made in the bone marrow But cancer and its treatment can damage and destroy cells in the bone marrow When hematopoietic stem cells are damaged, they may not supply all the blood cells that the body needs A stem cell rescue is a way to jumpstart the bone marrow to make more healthy blood cells Also called a hematopoietic stem cell transplant, stem cell rescue uses your own blood-forming stem cells to regrow your bone marrow A stem cell rescue has 3 key steps: h Stem cell removal \u2013 First, some of your healthy stem cells will be removed from your blood or bone marrow You may need a few visits to collect enough stem cells These collected stem cells are then frozen and stored for later High-dose chemotherapy \u2013 Next, you\u2019ll receive intensive chemotherapy to kill any lymphoma cells in your body The chemotherapy also kills all the stem cells in your bone marrow Because your blood count will be low, your body will be very vulnerable to infections at this time and you will feel very fatigued Stem cell replacement \u2013 After chemotherapy, your healthy stem cells will be thawed and returned back into your body to \u201crescue\u201d your damaged bone marrow Your transplanted stem cells will migrate to the bone marrow and start to grow new blood stem cells This will also begin to restore your body\u2019s ability to protect itself from infection You\u2019ll grow back blood cells and bone marrow in a few weeks, but it may take a year for your body to fully recover During this time, you\u2019ll have frequent blood tests and health checkups until your bone marrow is restored and your blood cell counts return to normal Stem cell rescue can be an intense procedure It\u2019s not for everyone with primary CNS lymphoma And it\u2019s only used after you\u2019ve had other treatments or if the lymphoma comes back after earlier treatment (relapse) Your treatment team will consider many factors to decide if a stem cell rescue is right for you Some of these factors include your fitness level, health status, organ function, cancer stage, previous treatments, other medical conditions, available supportive care, and High-dose chemotherapy and stem cell rescue First, stem cells are removed (harvested) from the patient\u2019s blood or bone marrow The harvested stem cells are concentrated and frozen for preservation Next, the patient receives high-dose chemotherapy to destroy any cancer cells in your body This also kills all the stem cells in the bone marrow Lastly, the harvested stem cells are returned (transfused) to the patient, where they\u2019ll grow new, healthy blood-forming stem cells in the bone marrow. additional factors\u2014including your goals and preferences Because the procedure can be risky and the side effects harsh, it may not be a useful option for people who are older or frail Ask your team about the benefits and risks of having a stem

shaped like mushrooms and stick out from the colon wall They have a stalk and round top Sessile polyps are flatter and do not have a stalk A polyp in which cancer has just started to grow is called a malignant (cancerous) polyp Most polyps can be removed during a colonoscopy, using a minor surgical procedure called a polypectomy Colon polyps Polyps are growths on the inner lining of the bowel wall Some look like mushrooms and stick out from the colon wall These are called pedunculated polyps Others are flatter and do not have a stalk These are called sessile polyps Often, no further treatment is needed after a polypectomy In other cases, surgery (resection) of a bigger piece of the colon is needed This depends on: The size and shape of the polyp (pedunculated or sessile), The polypectomy results, and The results of testing the removed tissue Before deciding whether resection is needed after a polypectomy, your doctor will review the results of testing with you and discuss your options Invasive cancer For cancers not found early enough to be removed by polypectomy, colectomy (colon surgery) is needed Surgery is only an option if the colon tumor can be completely removed If you cannot have surgery first, see page Colectomy A colectomy is a surgery that removes the part of the colon with cancer After the cancerous part is removed, the two healthy ends of the remaining colon are sewn or stapled together At least 12 lymph nodes near the tumor will be removed and tested for cancer, in addition to any nodes that look abnormal to the surgeon A colectomy can be done in two ways The open method removes tumor tissue through a Colectomy Surgery for colon cancer is called colectomy It involves removing the cancerous part of the colon The two healthy ends of the remaining colon are then attached to each other. large cut in your abdomen The minimally invasive method involves making a few small cuts Tools are inserted through the cuts to see and remove part of your colon The tissue removed during surgery is sent to a pathologist The pathologist determines how far the cancer has grown within the colon wall They also test the removed lymph nodes for cancer These results are used to assign the cancer a stage The stage helps determine whether you need chemotherapy after surgery At the time of colectomy, some people may also have a procedure called a colostomy This is done in cases where it may not be safe to reconnect the remaining sections of colon In a colostomy, the remaining upper part of the colon is attached to an opening on the surface of the abdomen This opening is called a stoma Stool exits the body through the stoma and enters a bag attached to the skin This is typically only needed for a short time For colon cancer surgery, the colostomy can often be reversed with another operation Colostomy is also known as diversion because it diverts (redirects) the flow of stool Colostomy If the two healthy ends of the remaining colon cannot be safely reconnected after the cancer is removed, a colostomy may be performed A colostomy connects a part of the colon to the outside of the abdomen This creates an opening in your abdomen that allows stool to pass through For colon cancer surgery, it is rare for a colostomy not to be reversed with another operation Bowel blockage In rare cases, a tumor may grow so large that it blocks the flow of stool There are several ways to deal with a blockage One option is a colectomy that also unblocks the bowel This is known as a one-stage colectomy A second option is colectomy with colostomy This is typically only needed for a short time Another possibility is that a colostomy may be done first, followed by a second surgery to remove the cancer Lastly, in rare cases, a mesh metal tube called a stent may be placed first, followed by a second surgery to remove the cancer The stent keeps the colon open, allowing gas and stool to pass", "extracted_entities": ["Colon", "adenoma",

gray zone lymphoma (MGZL) has overlapping features of primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) Treatment is usually chemotherapy Together, you and your care team will choose a treatment plan that is best for you Mediastinal gray zone lymphoma (MGZL) is different than primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) Those with gray zone lymphomas are best managed in cancer centers with experience in treating this type of lymphoma Overview Gray zone lymphomas have overlapping features of non-Hodgkin primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) This means that the cells are large but can vary in size and might look similar to Hodgkin cells (Reed-Sternberg cells) Reed-Sternberg cells are large, abnormal lymphocytes that may contain more than one nucleus There are 2 main types of gray zone lymphomas: Mediastinal gray zone lymphoma (MGZL) h Non-mediastinal gray zone lymphomas Mediastinal gray zone lymphomas Mediastinal lymphomas are growths found behind the breastbone (sternum) in the part of the chest that separates the lungs and holds the heart Mediastinal gray zone lymphoma (MGZL) is different than primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) They are treated differently Primary mediastinal lymphomas are discussed in Chapter MGZLs are more commonly seen in those between 20 to 40 years of age, assigned male at birth They are characterized by the presence of a large mediastinal mass Lymph nodes above the collar bone (supraclavicular) may be involved An expert hematopathologist review is essential to confirm the diagnosis of mediastinal gray zone lymphoma Non-mediastinal gray zone lymphomas Non-mediastinal gray zone lymphomas occur in older persons, have a higher rate of bone marrow involvement, include disease outside the lymph nodes (extranodal disease), and have more advanced-stage disease than mediastinal gray zone lymphomas However, those with cancer found outside the mediastinum (extra-mediastinal disease) should be diagnosed as having DLBCL, not otherwise specified (DLBCL-NOS), see page Treatment Since MGZL has features of both classical Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) and non-Hodgkin PMBL, treatment is a challenge Currently, there is no standard of care or agreement on treatment MGZL is usually treated with chemotherapy If the tumor cells are , rituximab might be added

Leukemia starts in the bone marrow To diagnose AML, samples of bone marrow are usually removed and tested before starting any treatment The bone marrow sample should be reviewed by a pathologist who is an expert in the diagnosis of AML This review is often referred to as histology, histopathology, or hematopathology review The pathologist will note the overall appearance and the size, shape, and type of cells Tests will be done on the biopsied cells There are 2 types of bone marrow tests that are often done at the same time: Bone marrow aspirate Bone marrow biopsy A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy are bedside procedures They are not surgeries and do not require an operating room Your care team will try to make you as comfortable as possible during the procedures In some places, sedation or anesthesia is provided during these procedures The samples are usually taken from the back of the hip bone (pelvis) You will likely lie on your belly or side For an aspirate, a hollow needle will be pushed through your skin and into the bone Liquid bone marrow will then be drawn into a syringe For the biopsy, a wider needle will be used to remove a small piece of bone You may feel bone pain at your hip for a few days Your skin may bruise If the blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) subtype of AML is suspected, you might also have a lymph node biopsy or a skin lesion biopsy Flow cytometry Flow cytometry is a laboratory method used to detect, identify, and count specific cells Flow cytometry involves adding a light-sensitive dye to cells The dyed cells are passed through a beam of light in a machine The machine measures the number of cells, as well as things like the size and shape of the cells Flow cytometry may be used on cells from circulating (peripheral) blood or from a bone marrow aspirate A blood test can count the number of white blood cells, but it cannot detect the subtle differences between different types of blood cancers Flow cytometry can detect these subtle differences The most common use of flow cytometry is in the identification of markers on cells, particularly in the immune system (called immunophenotyping) Immunophenotyping Immunophenotyping is a process that uses antibodies to detect the presence or absence of white blood cell antigens called biomarkers These antigens are proteins that can be found on the surface of or inside white blood cells Certain biomarkers are targeted in AML treatment Immunohistochemistry Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a special staining process that involves adding a chemical marker to cells The cells are then

Most of the information in this guide does not apply to SISCCA This guide applies to treatment of invasive anal cancer diagnosed by biopsy and found to be more advanced than SISCCA Testing after diagnosis After a biopsy confirms anal squamous cell carcinoma, more testing is needed to plan treatment Digital rectal exams are repeated This section describes additional recommended testing after diagnosis Lymph node exam There are hundreds of small bean-shaped structures called lymph nodes in the body Lymph nodes catch and filter out foreign particles and harmful cells, including cancer cells Certain areas of the body contain more lymph nodes than others The groin (where the thigh meets the abdomen) is one such area Lymph nodes in the groin are called the inguinal lymph nodes If left untreated, anal cancer cells can travel through lymphatics or blood to these groin lymph nodes or other lymph nodes in the pelvis, and then to other areas of the body Lymph nodes cannot usually be seen or felt in the early stages of cancer, but may become enlarged as cancer progresses Your doctor will examine lymph nodes in the groin by pressing on the surface of the skin This is known as palpation If any lymph nodes feel enlarged or look suspicious on imaging tests, a sample may be removed for testing A thin needle may be used to remove a sample of tissue from the node(s) This is called fine-needle aspiration (FNA) In some cases, all or part of a lymph node may be removed by cutting into the skin This is called an excisional biopsy Imaging Imaging for anal cancer allows your doctors to see areas inside the body in detail Imaging tests provide information on the extent of the cancer and whether it has spread to distant areas (metastasized) To learn the extent of anal cancer in the anus and nearby areas (including lymph nodes), either computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended To look for areas of cancer beyond the pelvis, a CT scan of the chest and abdomen with contrast is recommended In some cases, positron emission tomography (PET) may be combined with a CT or MRI CT, MRI, and PET are described below CT takes many pictures of areas inside of the body using x-rays A computer combines the x-rays to make one detailed picture The picture is saved for later viewing by a radiologist You will lie face-up on a table that moves through a tunnel-like machine A substance called contrast will be used to make the pictures clearer Before the CT scan, you will be asked to drink a large glass of oral contrast A contrast agent may also be injected into your vein It may cause you to feel flushed or get hives Rarely, serious allergic reactions occur Tell your doctors if you have had bad reactions to contrast in the past You will be alone during the scan, but a technician will be right outside the room You may hear buzzing or clicking during the scan MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to make pictures of areas inside the body MRI is especially good at making clear pictures of CT scans A CT scan of the chest and abdomen with contrast is recommended to look for areas of cancer beyond the pelvis, such as the liver or lungs Either CT or MRI is used to learn the extent of anal cancer in the pelvis. areas of soft tissue Unlike a CT scan, MRI does not use radiation Tell your doctor know if you have issues with small enclosed spaces CT or MRI may be combined with positron emission tomography (PET) PET involves first injecting radioactive glucose (sugar) into the body The radioactive sugar is detected with a special camera during the scan Cancer cells appear brighter than normal cells because they use sugar more quickly HIV testing People with HIV are at increased risk of developing anal cancer It is

the cancer It\u2019s a number rating of how far the cancer has grown into the bladder wall Numbers range from 0 to 4, where 0 means no growth into the bladder and 4 means it has grown through the bladder wall and out to other parts of the body Grade measures the overall aggressiveness of the cancer It\u2019s an estimate of the rate that the cancer is growing Cancer grade is either low grade (slow) or high grade (fast) How far and how fast You\u2019ve had many tests to learn about your cancer But before you receive treatment, your care team needs to figure out how far your cancer has grown and how fast it\u2019s growing This is done with staging and grading It\u2019s important for your care team to know the stage and the grade of your cancer to predict the course of your disease and to make a treatment plan The next chapters explain how these ratings are used to choose treatments But first, let\u2019s get to know more about staging and grading Layers of the bladder The wall of the bladder has four main layers From the inside to the outside, they are: Inner lining (urothelial layer) Connective tissue layer Muscle layer Outer fatty layer Stage Staging is a way to describe how much cancer is in your body, how much it has grown, and how far it has spread If the cancer has spread outside the bladder (metastasized), staging describes where it has spread to and whether it\u2019s affecting other parts of the body Staging uses your test results to identify and locate your cancer Staging helps you and your care team select the best therapy There are five stages of bladder cancer: 0, 1, 2, 3, and Some stages are also divided into subgroups You may see the cancer stage written with a T, where the T stands for tumor: T0, T1, T2, T3, and T An important thing about

made It\u2019s uncommon to find cancer cells in the bone marrow of people diagnosed with primary CNS lymphoma But if imaging suggests the possibility of lymphoma in the bones, your care team may recommend a bone marrow biopsy In this procedure, a hollow needle is inserted into the bone (usually at the back of the hip bone) and a sample of marrow is removed The marrow sample is then sent to a lab for testing What\u2019s next After you\u2019ve been diagnosed and have gone through further testing to find out the extent of your lymphoma, your treatment team will discuss your results with you You\u2019ll also talk about your choices for treatment The next chapter explains the different options for treating primary CNS lymphoma Don\u2019t dismiss your distress Depression, anxiety, and distress are very common in people with cancer (and their caregivers, too) About 1 in 3 patients with primary brain tumors develop clinical depression and anxiety at some point Up to 3 out of 4 people with primary brain tumors experience psychological distress Tell your treatment team if you\u2019re feeling stressed or overwhelmed Ask them for help You don\u2019t have to cope with it by yourself

will have no symptoms A person with one or more of these symptoms should visit a doctor or other health care provider who can recommend different tests These tests are used to make a diagnosis. (A diagnosis means identifying an illness by using tests.) What does aggressive mean Bladder cancer When health care professionals describe cancer as aggressive, they mean the cancer is likely to grow or spread more quickly than average Bladder cancer is often described by how far it has spread into the muscle layer of the bladder Here, the cancer tumor has grown through the inner lining (urothelial layer) and invaded the muscle layer in the bladder wall This type of cancer is known as muscleinvasive bladder cancer Aggressive can also be used to describe a treatment that\u2019s stronger or more intense than other treatment options Some people reading this book may have already been tested and given a diagnosis of bladder cancer For those who haven\u2019t been diagnosed yet, the only way to make sure you have bladder cancer is to have tests that: h Look inside your bladder (cystoscopy and imaging) Study your urine (urinalysis and cytology) Analyze a sample of surgically removed bladder tissue (resection and biopsy) We\u2019ll talk about these and other tests in Chapter What causes bladder cancer Many people wonder why they got cancer Cancer experts don\u2019t know exactly what causes bladder cells to grow out of control What they do know is that bladder cancer and other cancers start with abnormal changes (mutations) in the genes of cells Genes are tiny parts of a cell that carry the instructions for how cells behave These instructions also control how new cells are made Sometimes, mutations can mix up these instructions This can turn normal cells into cancer cells In most people with bladder cancer, these mutations aren\u2019t passed down in families (hereditary mutation) They happen on their own and only in cancer cells Still, you may have a higher risk for bladder cancer if another family member also had bladder cancer In rare cases, mutations in these genes can be passed down in families This results in an increased risk of getting bladder cancer However, only some individuals with these genetic mutations go on to develop bladder cancer What are the risk factors for bladder cancer A risk factor is something that increases your chance of developing a disease Risk factors don\u2019t necessarily cause bladder cancer But people with bladder cancer often have one or more of these risk factors: Smoking \u2013 Smoking is the greatest risk factor for bladder cancer It accounts for about half of all cases Secondhand smoke increases bladder cancer risk, too Quitting smoking, even after diagnosis, can still be helpful Age \u2013 The risk of bladder cancer increases as you age Family history \u2013 Your risk increases if you or anyone in your family has had bladder cancer Also, people with an inherited condition called Lynch syndrome have a greater risk of cancer in the urinary tract, including bladder cancer Chemical exposure \u2013 Some chemicals used in dyes, rubber, leather, printing materials, textiles, and paint products have been linked to an increased risk for bladder cancer How advanced is my bladder cancer Once bladder cancer is found, it\u2019s important to know how far it has grown or spread Bladder cancer advances in 3 phases: Non\u2013muscle-invasive bladder cancer has grown on or in the bladder\u2019s inner layer of urothelial cells, but not into the bladder\u2019s muscle layer Muscle-invasive bladder cancer has grown through the bladder\u2019s inner urothelial layer and into its muscle layer But it hasn\u2019t grown anywhere else Metastatic bladder cancer has spread outside the bladder to other areas of the body Common areas of metastatic bladder cancer include the lymph nodes, bones, lungs, liver, and the inner wall of the abdomen. (Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped glands that transport a fluid called lymph and help fight infection Lymph nodes are found around the urinary tract and all over the body.) Treatment is different for each of these three phases of bladder cancer These phases are further divided into stages, which are explained in Chapter Bladder cancer treatment What\u2019s the best treatment for bladder cancer There\u2019s no single treatment that\u2019s best for everyone The best treatment for bladder cancer is the treatment that\u2019s best for you You\u2019ll work with your treatment team to choose which option makes the most sense for you", "extracted_entities": ["bladder cancer", "cystoscopy", "urinalysis", "cytology", "resection", "biopsy", "Lynch syndrome", "lymph nodes"], "extracted_triples": [["bladder cancer", "is diagnosed by", "cystoscopy"], ["bladder cancer", "is diagnosed by", "urinalysis"], ["bladder cancer", "is diagnosed by", "cytology"], ["bladder cancer", "is diagnosed by", "resection"], ["bladder cancer", "is diagnosed by", "biopsy"], ["bladder cancer", "can be caused by", "Lynch syndrome"], ["bladder cancer", "is associated with", "lymph nodes"], ["lymph nodes", "help fight", "infection"], ["bladder cancer", "has risk factors including", "smoking"], ["bladder cancer", "has risk factors including", "age"], ["bladder cancer", "has risk factors including", "family history"], ["bladder cancer", "has risk factors including", "chemical exposure"], ["bladder cancer", "advances in", "3 phases"], ["non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer", "is a phase of", "bladder cancer"], ["muscle-invasive bladder cancer", "is a phase of", "bladder cancer"], ["metastatic bladder cancer", "is a phase of", "bladder cancer"]]}, {"idx": "chunk-0190c2d4ef339b49f71cad0ca2a082e4", "passage": "4_Bladder Cancer_processed\nbladder wall to see if the tumor has invaded the muscle layer Remove all the visible tumor After the procedure, most people can go home the same day But you\u2019ll need a few days to rest and recover You may feel pain or burning when you urinate and have blood in your urine for the following 2 weeks or so Another TURBT procedure may be needed about 2 to 6 weeks after the first one The second TURBT is done to make sure all the tumor is removed Or it may be done to get a deeper biopsy sample for the pathologist to examine A treatment called intravesical therapy is often done in combination with TURBT. (More about intravesical therapy to follow.) Bladder removal A procedure called a cystectomy treats bladder cancer by removing the entire bladder When the word radical is used, it means taking out the bladder as well as nearby lymph nodes If the disease has spread farther, sometimes other nearby organs also need to be removed, including: Urethra Prostate Seminal vesicles (glands that help make semen) TURBT A transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) is a procedure that examines and removes tumors on the bladder wall Part of the vas deferens (a tube that carries sperm away from the testicles) Proximal urethra (part of the urethra that goes through the prostate) Uterus Ovaries Fallopian tubes Part of the vagina Radical cystectomy is the most widely used surgery for muscle-invasive bladder cancer It\u2019s a major operation that involves cutting into your abdomen You\u2019ll need to stay in the hospital for at least several days It may take 2 to 3 months or longer for you to recover Common side effects and complications of a radical cystectomy include constipation, diarrhea, bleeding, bowel problems, infections, and changes in sexual function Talk to your Cystectomy Cystectomy is surgery to remove the bladder A radical cystectomy removes the entire bladder, nearby lymph nodes, and other organs It\u2019s the most common surgery for muscle-invasive bladder cancer A partial cystectomy removes part of the bladder It\u2019s rarely used for bladder cancer. urologist and treatment team about the risks, benefits, and side effects of a radical cystectomy Because a radical cystectomy removes your entire bladder, you\u2019ll need a new way for urine to exit your body So another procedure, called a urinary diversion, is also done at the same time To find out about the 3 types of urinary diversion, see the next page Partial cystectomy A partial cystectomy is a surgical procedure to remove part of the bladder It\u2019s not widely used for the treatment of bladder cancer Fewer than 1 out of 20 people with bladder cancer are eligible for a partial cystectomy It can only be done if the cancer is in a spot that can be neatly removed without taking out the whole bladder Types of urinary diversion If your bladder is removed, urine needs another way to leave your body This requires an additional surgical procedure called a urinary diversion There are 3 types of urinary diversions: Ileal conduit In this urinary diversion, the surgeon removes a section of the small intestine (ileum) to use as a tube (or conduit) The surgeon also creates a small hole, called a stoma, in the abdominal wall One end of the tube is connected to the ureters, much like the bladder was The other end of the tube is attached to the stoma Urine drains from the kidneys and ureters, passes through the tube, and exits the body through the stoma Urine can trickle out of the stoma at any time A small disposable bag is attached to the outside of your abdomen to collect the urine when it comes out of the stoma This is called an ostomy bag (or ostomy pouch) The bag is attached to your body with the help of an adhesive ring The ring sticks to the skin and acts as a watertight barrier Most people find that they need to empty the bag every 2 to 4 hours, depending on how much liquid they drink A closable spout at the bottom of the bag allows the urine to be emptied into a toilet without taking off the bag Neobladder For this procedure, the bladder is replaced with a segment of small intestine that acts like a new bladder (neobladder) Like the original bladder, this substitute bladder is attached to the ureters at one end and to the urethra at the other end", "extracted_entities": ["Bladder Cancer", "TURBT", "cystectomy", "urethra", "prostate", "seminal vesicles", "vas deferens", "proximal urethra",

anesthesia or deep sedation is often required, especially for the first applicator placement The applicator is placed to align with the tissue targeted for treatment Often, an imaging technique (MRI or CT) is used to guide placement of the applicator These images are used to design the brachytherapy treatment plan The applicator is connected to a brachytherapy machine A radiation source travels from the machine through the hollow tubes and into the applicator Treatment takes about 10 minutes Sometimes brachytherapy is given as treatments over a couple days In this case, the instruments are placed and left in the body until all the treatments have been given (1 to 2 days) You will need to remain in bed until treatment is complete so that the instruments don\u2019t move Brachytherapy is typically started in the final week or right after completing EBRT Shrinking the tumor with EBRT first allows for better placement of the brachytherapy applicators Treatment with both types of radiation therapy can be completed within 7 to 8 weeks Side effects The side effects of brachytherapy are similar to those of EBRT and include: h Skin irritation near treatment area Tiredness (fatigue) Soreness in your pelvic area Difficulty urinating or painful urination Softer bowel movements or diarrhea Increased vaginal discharge Systemic therapy Systemic therapy is treatment with substances that travel in the bloodstream, reaching cells throughout the body Chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy are types of systemic therapy Most systemic therapies are given intravenously This means they are slowly infused into your bloodstream through a vein Infusions are often given in cycles of treatment days followed by days of rest This allows your body to recover between cycles Chemotherapy Platinum-based chemotherapy is the most commonly used systemic therapy for cervical cancer It stops the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing Cisplatin is generally preferred for platinumbased chemotherapy If cisplatin is expected to be too harsh or cannot be given for other reasons, a different platinum drug called carboplatin may be used instead As part of treatment with chemoradiation, cisplatin is typically given on a 7-day cycle (once weekly) for 5 to 6 weeks When used for recurrent or metastatic cancer, infusions are typically given once every 3 weeks Targeted therapy and immunotherapy Targeted therapy and immunotherapy are newer types of systemic therapy Unlike chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy are most effective at treating cancers with specific features, called biomarkers They may be options for treating cervical cancer that returns or spreads after treatment with chemotherapy Side effects of systemic therapy Systemic therapy can kill healthy cells in addition to cancer cells The damage to healthy cells causes potentially harsh side effects The side effects of chemotherapy depend on many factors, including the drug(s), the dose, and the person In general, side effects are caused by the death of fast-growing cells, which are found in the intestines, mouth, and blood As a result, common side effects include: Loss of appetite Nausea Vomiting Mouth sores Hair loss Fatigue Increased risk of infection Bleeding or bruising easily Nerve damage (neuropathy) Cisplatin can damage the kidneys People whose kidneys do not work well may not be able to have cisplatin An alternative chemotherapy drug may be used Cisplatin can also cause ringing in the ears

emission tomography (PET) scan uses a radioactive drug called a tracer A tracer is a substance injected into a vein to help see cancer cells in the body PET scans are performed about an hour after the tracer is injected PET scans are combined with CT or MRI scans (PET/CT or PET/MRI) to determine where the cancer cells are located This combined test is considered to be more accurate than either scan alone Types of PET scans that can be helpful for those with adrenal tumors include FDG-PET and SSTRPET FDG-PET/CT scan An FDG-PET scan uses a radioactive type of sugar (18-fluorodeoxyglucose) as its tracer Active cancer cells use sugar faster than normal cells This will make the cells look brighter in pictures Many adrenal tumors are not fast-growing and not very bright on FDG-PET scans FDG-PET scans can help determine if neuroendocrine tumors are becoming more aggressive SSTR-PET/CT scan A somatostatin receptor (SSTR) antagonist is a protein found on the surface of cells that bind to a hormone called somatostatin Somatostatin helps to control other hormones in the body SSTRs are found on many different types of cells A SSTR-PET uses a tracer that binds to these SSTRs Blood tests Blood tests are used to look for signs of hormone secretion or to see how well you are responding to certain treatments Biochemical tests Biochemical tests measure substances like hormones in blood, urine, and/or saliva that may be made by the adrenal tumor Symptoms may be seen when your body makes too much of a hormone Your doctor may consider these tests if you may have an adrenal tumor or

Cancer_processed\nThe esophagus Parts of the esophagus Esophageal cancer How cancer spreads Key points The esophagus is a long, muscular tube through which food passes from the throat to the stomach Esophageal cancer starts when abnormal cells grow out of control in the layers of the esophagus inner lining The esophagus The esophagus is located behind the trachea (windpipe) and in front of the spine It is part of the digestive system The digestive system transports and breaks down food, absorbs nutrients, and removes waste from the body It includes the esophagus, stomach, liver, pancreas, small intestine, colon, rectum, and anus Food and drink enter the mouth and move through the esophagus into the stomach When you swallow, small contractions, called peristalsis, along with gravity and pressure, move food down the esophagus and into the stomach Except during the act of swallowing, the esophagus is normally empty The esophagus is about 10 inches long and about 1 inch wide It has two sphincters, circular muscles that normally remain closed except during the act of swallowing One sphincter is located at the top of the esophagus and the other at the bottom, between the esophagus and the stomach The digestive tract The digestive or gastrointestinal (GI) tract is part of the digestive system Food enters the mouth and passes through the esophagus into the stomach After being broken down into a liquid, food enters the small intestine The large intestine prepares unused food to be moved out of the body Parts of the esophagus Esophagus wall The esophagus wall contains 4 layers: Mucosa \u2013 inner membrane that is in contact with food It has 3 parts: Epithelium \u2013 innermost lining and is normally made up of flat, thin cells called squamous cells Lamina propria \u2013 thin layer of connective tissue under the epithelium Muscularis mucosa - very thin layer of muscle under the lamina propria Submucosa \u2013 layer of connective tissue just below the mucosa that contains blood vessels, nerves, and lymphatic vessels In some parts of the esophagus, this layer also includes glands that secrete mucus Muscularis propria \u2013 thick layer of muscle under the submucosa It contracts in a coordinated way to push food down the esophagus from the throat to the stomach (peristalsis) Tunica adventitia \u2013 outermost layer, made of connective tissue Upper esophagus The upper part of the esophagus is made of striated muscle Striated muscle generates force and contracts It is under your control (voluntary) Middle esophagus The middle part of the esophagus is a mixture of striated and smooth muscle Lower esophagus The lower part of the esophagus consists only of smooth muscle Smooth muscle is not under your control It is involuntary, like a reflex Esophagogastric junction The esophagogastric junction (EGJ) is the place where the stomach and the esophagus meet, found just beneath the diaphragm It is also called the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) It separates the contents of the esophagus from the contents of the stomach (acid) Esophageal cancer Cancer of the esophagus (or esophageal cancer) starts when cells in the epithelium of the esophagus begin to grow out of control There are 2 types of esophageal cancer: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) starts in the thin, flat cells found in the inner lining of the esophagus Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is often found in the upper and middle esophagus but can occur in the lower esophagus as well Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) starts in the mucus-making cells of the inner lining of the esophagus Adenocarcinomas are often found in the lower esophagus but can occur in the middle esophagus as well Today, most esophageal cancers in North America and Western Europe are adenocarcinomas Squamous cell carcinoma is more common in Eastern Europe, Asia, and Africa Treatment is based on the type and location of esophageal cancer, in addition to the stage of the tumor (where it is in the body) Some tumors that start in the stomach and cross over into the area between the esophagus and stomach (esophagogastric junction) are treated as esophageal cancers and not as stomach cancers However, this depends on the exact location of the tumor Siewert types used as part of cancer staging describe where the tumor is relative to the esophagus and stomach Barrett

or fluid Samples removed during a biopsy or surgery will be sent to a pathologist, an expert in examining cells using a microscope (called cytology) to confirm the presence of cancer The pathologist will determine the cancer subtype called tumor histology A fine-needle aspiration (FNA), fine-needle biopsy (FNB), and core needle biopsy (CNB) use needles of different sizes to remove a sample of tumor or lymph node An ultrasound (US) or CT scan might be used to guide a lymph node biopsy Biopsy of metastasis Metastasis is the spread of cancer to an area of the body such as lymph nodes or lung A biopsy of the metastasis may be needed to confirm the presence of cancer If there is more than one metastasis, each site may be biopsied The type of biopsy used depends on the location of the suspected metastases and other factors Biomarker testing Biomarker tumor testing includes tests of genes or their products (proteins) It identifies the presence or absence of mutations and certain proteins that might suggest treatment This information is used to choose the best treatment for you It is sometimes called molecular testing or tumor profiling, tumor sequencing, gene expression profiling, or genomic testing Inside our cells are deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules These molecules are tightly packaged into what is called a chromosome Chromosomes contain most of the genetic information in a cell Normal human cells contain 23 pairs of chromosomes for a total of 46 chromosomes Each chromosome contains thousands of genes Genes are coded instructions for the proteins your cells make Most genes contain information about a specific protein A mutation is when something goes wrong in the genetic code MSI-H/dMMR mutation Microsatellites are short, repeated strings of DNA When errors or defects occur, they are fixed by mismatch repair (MMR) proteins Some cancers have DNA mutations or changes that prevent these errors from being fixed This is called microsatellite instability (MSI) or deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) When cancer cells have more than a normal number of microsatellites, it is called MSI-H (microsatellite instability-high) This is often due to dMMR genes PD-L1 testing Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is an immune protein If this protein is expressed on the surface of cancer cells, it can cause your immune cells to ignore the cancer and suppress the anti-tumor immune response This is designed to activate your immune system to better fight off the cancer cells PDL1 expression is measured using a combined positive score (CPS), which measures the immune proteins in your tumor and your immune system If your cancer expresses this protein and has a CPS of at least 1 percent or higher, you might have treatment that combines chemotherapy and an immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, or have immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy by itself Tumor p16 (HPV) testing HPV testing by p16 is recommended for everyone diagnosed with throat (oropharyngeal) cancer It is used to learn more information about your cancer Testing will be done on a biopsy of your tumor from either your throat, a lymph node, or other sites in your body if needed Tumor mutational burden When there are 10 or more mutations per million base pairs of tumor DNA, it is called tumor mutational burden-high (TMB-H) Metastatic or unresectable TMB cancers are often treated using immune checkpoint inhibitors that target the proteins called programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) Tumor mutation testing Tumor mutation

type of blood cancer that starts in the stem cells of bone marrow There are many subtypes of AML found in adults This chapter will provide an overview of AML What is AML In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), abnormal changes stop very immature white blood cells called myeloid blasts or myeloblasts from becoming mature blood cells As a result, there is a buildup of blasts in the bone marrow and blood In turn, there are not enough healthy red blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells This causes serious health issues For this reason, AML is fatal if left untreated Subtypes of AML There are many subtypes of AML They are grouped and treated based on the presence or absence of certain gene mutations or abnormal chromosomes and other factors In addition to AML, this book includes information about the following: Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) Why you should read this book Making decisions about cancer care can be stressful You may need to make tough decisions under pressure about complex choices The NCCN Guidelines for Patients are trusted by patients and providers They clearly explain current care recommendations made by respected experts in the field Recommendations are based on the latest research and practices at leading cancer centers Cancer care is not the same for everyone By following expert recommendations for your situation, you are more likely to improve your care and have better outcomes as a result Use this book as your guide to find the information you need to make important decisions What is blood AML is a type of blood cancer Blood is a tissue A tissue is a group of cells that work together to perform a function Blood\u2019s function is to move oxygen and nutrients throughout your body and carry away waste Blood also plays an important role for the immune system and in preventing bleeding There are 4 main components of blood\u2014plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets Types of blood cells Your blood contains different types of cells that float in plasma Plasma is a clear, yellowish fluid made up of mostly water There are 3 types of blood cells: Red blood cells (RBCs or erythrocytes) carry oxygen throughout the body White blood cells (WBCs or leukocytes) fight infections WBCs include granulocytes (or neutrophils), monocytes, and

at its molecular components Tumors often release molecules that can be used as clues for finding and learning about the cancer This information helps figure out the likelihood that your cancer could spread to other parts of the body It can also help predict whether the cancer could transform into a more aggressive type Importantly, targeted therapies (PARP inhibitors, for example) can be used against cancers that have particular molecular tumor markers So the testing looks for specific abnormalities in a number of genes involved in DNA repair, including BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2, FANCA, and others Tumor staging Tumors come in different shapes and sizes So it\u2019s not easy to compare one tumor to another To solve this problem, cancer experts created the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system to describe any tumor It\u2019s based on the results of your imaging scans, biopsies, and blood tests In this system, the letters T, N, and M stand for different areas of cancer growth: T (tumor) \u2013 Describes the size of the main (primary) tumor and if it has grown outside the prostate N (node) \u2013 Identifies whether cancer has spread to lymph nodes M (metastasis) \u2013 Indicates if cancer has spread (metastasized) to parts of the body outside of the pelvis Your provider will assign a number to each letter, based on your test results The higher the number, the larger the tumor (T) or the more the cancer has spread (M) These scores are combined to assign a \u201cstage\u201d to the cancer Staging is a way to describe how much cancer is in your body and how far it has spread Knowing your stage is important for predicting the course of your disease and for making a treatment plan Cancer staging is done when you\u2019re first diagnosed It may also be done after treatment to confirm that the stage hasn\u2019t changed How to read a TNM score Let\u2019s say your prostate cancer is given a TNM score of T4, N1, MThis score means that the tumor has grown outside the prostate gland (T4) and has spread to nearby lymph nodes (N1) and to one or more distant parts of the body (M1) Why know your TNM score For one, it lets you know the extent of your cancer It also helps characterize your risk for the cancer to spread Your level of risk helps indicate the most appropriate treatment for you Measurements and assessments not covered in this book include PSA density, Gleason score, Grade Group, and risk groups To learn more about these, see the NCCN Guidelines for Patients: Early-Stage Prostate Cancer, which can be found at NCCN.org/ patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app What\u2019s next After you\u2019ve had all these tests to confirm you have prostate cancer, your care team will discuss your test results and will work with you to develop a plan for treatment The next chapter describes the different treatment options for advanced-stage prostate cancer After that chapter, you\u2019ll read about which of those treatments may be right for you and your particular type of cancer Key points Tests are used to plan treatment and check how well treatment is working An unusually high amount of PSA in the bloodstream may be a sign of prostate cancer Imaging tests are used to see where the cancer has spread beyond the prostate Imaging also shows the size and location of the cancer A biopsy is a procedure that removes samples of cells or tissue, which are tested for cancer A genetic test is used to find abnormal changes (mutations) in your genes An inherited genetic mutation occurs in every cell in your body A somatic mutation occurs all by itself and is only found in the cells of a tumor To find out if you have an inherited risk for cancer, talk to your doctor about germline testing or ask to be referred to a genetic counselor. 3 Prostate cancer treatments Hormone therapy Non-hormone therapy Clinical trials Supportive care What\u2019s next Key points There\u2019s more than one treatment for advanced

The cervix Cervical changes Risk factors Types of cervical cancer Key points Cervical cancer is a common cancer of the female reproductive system Most cervical cancers are caused by long-term infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection The use of Pap smears has resulted in much lower rates of cervical cancer in the United States The cervix The cervix is the narrow, lower end of the uterus The uterus is where a baby grows and develops before being born During birth, the cervix opens (dilates) and thins (effaces) to allow the baby to move into the vagina The vagina, or birth canal, is the muscular passage through which babies are born An ovary and a fallopian tube are on each side of the upper uterus The fallopian tubes connect to the top part of the uterus The ovaries make eggs for sexual reproduction They also make hormones that affect breast growth, body shape, and the menstrual cycle Eggs pass out of the ovary and travel through the attached fallopian tube into the uterus The cervix, uterus, vagina, ovaries, and fallopian tubes are part of the female reproductive system The female reproductive system The reproductive system is a group of organs that work together for the purpose of sexual reproduction In addition to the uterus (and cervix), this system includes the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and vagina Most cervical cancers start in the thin layer of tissue that lines the outer part and inner parts of the cervix The ectocervix is the outer part of the cervix It appears rounded and extends into the vagina The ectocervix can be seen during an examination of the vagina and cervix using a tool called a speculum It is lined with cells called squamous cells In the center of the ectocervix is a narrow opening called the external os During menstruation, the external os opens slightly to allow blood to pass into the vagina The endocervix (endocervical canal) is the inner part of the cervix that forms a canal between the vagina and the body of the uterus The endocervix is lined with columnar (glandular) cells that make mucus The inner os is the upper part of the endocervix that serves as an opening between the uterus and the cervix The area where the endocervix and ectocervix meet is called the squamo-columnar junction or the transformation zone Most cervical cancers and pre-cancers start in the ectocervix portion of the transformation zone The cervical stroma is the thick layer of muscular tissue beneath the cervical lining The parametrium is the fat and connective tissue that surrounds the uterus (and cervix) and connects it to the pelvis Although the cervix is part of the uterus, uterine cancer is diagnosed and treated differently than cervical cancer This patient guide does not discuss treatment of uterine cancers, such as endometrial cancer and uterine sarcomas Cervical changes Cervical cancer starts as areas of abnormal, microscopic cells on the surface of the cervix These changes are known as cervical dysplasia or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) Mutations (changes) in the DNA of these cells cause them to become abnormal If left untreated, cervical dysplasia may become cervical cancer CIN is graded based on the depth of the abnormal cells on the lining of the cervix The possible grades are 1, 2, or Cervical dysplasia becomes cancer when the abnormal cells invade the muscular tissue beneath the cervical lining (the cervical stroma) An area of dysplasia or cancer is also referred to as a lesion Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) refers to mild dysplasia (CIN 1) High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) refers to moderate or severe dysplasia (CIN 2 and 3) HSIL is considered a pre-cancer Cervical changes Cervical dysplasia refers to areas of abnormal cells on the lining of the cervix Lowgrade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) refers to mild dysplasia (CIN 1) High-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) refers to moderate or severe dysplasia (CIN 2 and 3) HSIL is considered a pre-cancer Risk factors A risk factor is something that increases the risk of developing a disease Some people with no known risk

neck ultrasounds, TSH-stimulated testing (testing while thyroid hormone is stopped), or imaging procedures such as CT or MRI After lobectomy Short-term follow-up after lobectomy involves a physical exam and TSH blood test A neck ultrasound is also recommended 6 to 12 months after surgery Unlike after total thyroidectomy, Tg testing isn\u2019t helpful after lobectomy If there is no evidence of disease, longer-term surveillance includes physical exams, TSH blood tests, and neck ultrasound Talk to your care team about how often you need to have ultrasounds Survivorship In addition to surveillance testing, a range of other care is important for cancer survivors See Chapter 7: Survivorship for more information Recurrence Although the thyroid has been removed, cancer can return to the neck or to areas far from the neck The return of cancer after treatment is called recurrence Biomarker testing Biomarkers are targetable features of a cancer Many are mutations (changes) in the DNA of the cancer cells For thyroid cancers with 1 or more specific biomarkers, targeted therapy or immunotherapy may be a treatment option if needed Biomarker testing involves analyzing a piece of tumor tissue in a lab or testing a sample of blood Testing for the following biomarkers is recommended for recurrent, advanced, or metastatic cancers that can't be treated with RAI therapy: h ALK gene fusion NTRK gene fusion BRAF gene mutations RET gene fusion (found in some medullary thyroid cancers) Mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) Tumor mutational burden-high (TMB-H) Your provider may test for these individually or as part of a group Testing for many biomarkers at one time is called nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) Cancer that returns to the neck If the cancer can be removed based on its size and location, surgery is the preferred treatment For cancers that take up iodine, treatment with RAI therapy will also be considered But, treatment isn't always needed If the cancer isn't getting worse and isn't close to any critical structures, your provider may recommend close monitoring instead of treatment If the cancer can't be removed with surgery, doesn\u2019t take up iodine, and is getting worse (progressing), treatment with radiation therapy, targeted therapy, or both may be an option The preferred targeted therapy for cancer that can\u2019t be removed with surgery and is progressing is lenvatinib (Lenvima) Another recommended option is sorafenib (Nexavar) If the cancer gets worse after treatment with 1 or both of these, cabozantinib (Cabometyx) is recommended For cancers with certain gene mutations or other features, biomarker-based therapy may also be an option for recurrence See Guide 1 on the next page If the therapies discussed above aren\u2019t available or appropriate, joining a clinical trial is strongly encouraged Metastatic cancer Thyroid cancer that spreads to areas far from the neck is known as metastatic Metastatic tumors can form anywhere but are most common in the lungs, liver, muscles, bones, brain, and spinal cord If the cancer takes up iodine, RAI therapy is recommended to treat metastatic papillary, follicular, or oncocytic thyroid cancers Local therapies, such as radiation therapy, may also be used to treat areas of cancer directly If RAI therapy isn\u2019t an option If the cancer doesn't take up iodine, targeted therapy may be an option But, if the metastatic tumors are growing slowly (or not at all) and aren't causing symptoms, monitoring the cancer may be a better option Some people live with their thyroid cancer for months or years without needing treatment You will continue to take levothyroxine to keep your TSH level down To learn whether you are eligible for treatment with a targeted therapy or immunotherapy, biomarker testing is recommended This testing is described in more detail on page Recommended targeted therapies for metastatic cancer that

pathologist, an expert in examining cells using a microscope (called cytology) to confirm the presence of cancer The pathologist will determine the cancer subtype called tumor histology A fine-needle aspiration (FNA), fine needle biopsy (FNB), and core needle biopsy (CNB) use needles of different sizes to remove a sample of tumor or lymph node An ultrasound or CT scan might be used to guide a lymph node biopsy Biopsy of metastasis Metastasis is the spread of cancer to an area of the body such as lymph nodes or lung A biopsy of the metastasis may be needed to confirm the presence of cancer

deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules These molecules are tightly packaged into what is called a chromosome Chromosomes contain most of the genetic information in a cell Normal human cells contain 23 pairs of chromosomes for a total of 46 chromosomes Each chromosome contains thousands of genes Genes are coded instructions for the proteins your cells make Most genes contain information about a specific protein A mutation is when something goes wrong in the genetic code Biomarker tumor testing includes tests of genes or their products (proteins) It identifies the presence or absence of mutations and certain proteins that might suggest treatment This information may be helpful when choosing the best treatment for you It is sometimes called molecular testing or tumor profiling, tumor sequencing, gene expression profiling, or genomic testing These tests are generally used in advanced or widely spread (metastatic) cancers However, in comparison to other cancers, molecular testing has limited value in the treatment of mouth cancers since there are few drugs that specifically target the genetic mutations causing mouth cancers to grow and spread MSI-H/dMMR mutation Microsatellites are short, repeated strings of DNA When errors or defects occur, they are fixed by mismatch repair (MMR) proteins Some cancers have DNA mutations or changes that prevent these errors

Some members of your care team will be with you throughout cancer treatment, while others will only be there for parts of it Get to know your care team and help them get to know you Your team might include the following doctors: A hematologist or hematologic oncologist is a medical expert in blood diseases and blood cancers and treats these conditions A medical oncologist treats cancer using systemic (drug) therapy A pathologist or hematopathologist analyzes the cells and tissues removed during a biopsy and provides cancer diagnosis, staging, and information about biomarker testing

systemic therapy should be discussed before starting treatment Your preferences about treatment are important If you have any religious or personal beliefs about certain kinds of treatment, now would be the time to share them with your care team You will likely get either a catheter or a port to deliver systemic therapy, fluids, and blood products into your body A catheter is a thin, long tube

catheter or port will be tailored to your needs and treatment plans Treatment options Treatment options are often described in the following ways: Preferred therapies have the most evidence they work better and may be safer than other therapies Other recommended therapies may not work quite as well as preferred therapies, but they can still help treat cancer Therapies used in certain cases work best for people with specific cancer features or health circumstances Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is the standard of care for treating AML Chemotherapy kills fast-dividing cells throughout the body,

decades after the initial infection Experts are still learning why one person gets cervical cancer and another does not Other types of cancer caused by HPV include anal, head and neck, penile, vaginal, and vulvar cancers There are more than 100 types (strains) of HPV Infection with some strains is more likely to lead to cancer High-risk forms include HPV16 and HPV-Other HPV types can cause abnormal skin growths, called warts, to form on the anus, genitals, or other areas of the body A vaccine that protects against 9 different strains of HPV, including the highest-risk strains, is

vaccines available in other parts of the world One protects against HPV-16 and HPV-18 only The other targets these and two additional types The vaccine works best in younger people (ideally under age 13) because they are less likely to have been exposed to HPV And, while the vaccine can prevent new HPV infections, it does not treat existing HPV infections or HPVrelated cancer Other risk factors Other risk factors for cervical cancer are listed below Some of these lead to a higher risk because they either increase the risk of being exposed to HPV or they weaken the immune system, which can

also considered locally advanced Locally advanced cancers are not metastatic The information in this section applies to the following stages: Stage 1B3 and 2A2 Stage 2B Stage 3 Stage 4A Locally advanced cancers are more likely to have spread to lymph nodes than early-stage cancers Knowing whether lymph nodes in the pelvis or abdomen contain cancer can help guide treatment with EBRT for these cancers You may have extra imaging to look for lymph nodes with cancer Another approach is to surgically remove and test lymph nodes before any treatment is given A minimally invasive method is typically used to access and remove the lymph nodes This is called surgical staging If surgical staging is performed, the para-aortic lymph nodes are typically removed Pelvic lymph nodes may or may not be removed Treatment with all of the following is recommended for most locally advanced cervical cancers: Chemoradiation (EBRT and platinum chemotherapy) Brachytherapy If cancer is found in pelvic lymph nodes, EBRT will include the pelvis If any para-aortic nodes are known or suspected to have cancer, EBRT will be given to a larger treatment area that includes these nodes as well While

the NCCN Guidelines for Patients NCCN.org/patients/response Surveillance After finishing treatment, you will have testing to look for early signs of possible recurrence This is known as surveillance The information that follows applies to surveillance for common types of cervical cancer and for small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the cervix (NECC) Physical exams Physical exams performed by your oncologist are an important part of surveillance, especially in the first 5 years after treatment At these follow-up visits, tell your doctor about any changes in your health Such changes include new or worsening symptoms and other health conditions or concerns The recommended time frames for these follow-up visits are as follows: Years 1 and 2: Every 3 to 6 months Years 3, 4, and 5: Every 6 to 12 months After year 5: Once a year or as agreed upon with your doctor Time frame ranges are used to allow for differences in individual risk of recurrence and in patient and provider preference Those considered at higher risk of recurrence may benefit from more frequent exams than those with a lower risk After the fifth year, visits are generally spaced out to once per year Or you and your doctor may agree on a different schedule after discussing your personal risk of recurrence Imaging Unlike physical exams, imaging is generally not needed at regular intervals for an extended time

scan is preferred, but a CT with contrast is also a recommended option The area from the neck to the mid-thigh will be scanned Other imaging for these stages may include a pelvic MRI with contrast 3 to 6 months after finishing treatment Metastatic cancer For stage 4B or distant recurrences of cervical cancer, imaging is used mainly to learn how the cancer is responding to systemic therapy Imaging may include CT, MRI, and/or PET/CT Pap tests Depending on the type of surgery you have (if any), you may have annual Pap screening tests after treatment Pap testing is helpful for finding new areas of

it is used to make pictures of the inside of the body It might be referred to as a radiograph Bone scan A bone scan uses a radiotracer A radiotracer is a substance that releases small amounts of radiation Before the pictures are taken, the tracer will be injected into your vein It can take a few hours for the tracer to enter your bones A special camera will take pictures of the tracer in your bones as it moves over your body Areas of bone damage take up more radiotracer than healthy bone and show up as bright spots on the pictures Bone damage can be caused by cancer, cancer treatment, previous injuries, or other health problems such as arthritis The scan takes about 30 minutes You will be asked to hold still during the scan At one point the scanner will be less than one inch from

concurrently (during the same time period) in a treatment strategy called chemoradiation Chemoradiation is recommended for most locally advanced cervical cancers These cancers have grown beyond the cervix but have not spread to the liver, lungs, or bones As part of chemoradiation, there are typically 5 EBRT treatment sessions per week for 5 to 6 weeks Chemotherapy is typically given once weekly during this time See page 37 for more information on chemotherapy Brachytherapy Also known as internal radiation therapy, brachytherapy involves treatment with radioactive material placed inside the body Brachytherapy allows a high dose of radiation to be targeted at the tumor while limiting the amount delivered to surrounding normal tissue During brachytherapy, instruments are placed into the cervix, uterus, and vagina A radioactive material then travels into the instruments that have been placed in the body This method is known as intracavitary brachytherapy Sometimes, additional instruments (catheters, or thin hollow tubes) are placed in the tumor itself or in tissues next to the tumor (interstitial brachytherapy) For the treatment of cervical cancer, intracavitary brachytherapy is most often used Interstitial brachytherapy is a specialized technique that is used for more advanced cancers that involve the parametrium It is best performed at cancer centers with experience in this method Brachytherapy for cervical cancer may be given in short bursts, called high dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy, or in long bursts, called low dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy Most centers currently use HDR brachytherapy Treatment is typically given in 3 to 5 sessions over 2 weeks If you have not had a hysterectomy, a device called an applicator is inserted into the uterus through the vagina A \u201ctandem and ring\u201d applicator is commonly used for HDR brachytherapy The tandem is a long, thin tube that extends into the uterus The ring is a hollow circle that stays in the vagina, pressed against the cervix A tandem and ovoid applicator uses hollow, rounded capsules instead of a ring General anesthesia or deep sedation is often required, especially for the first

metastasis (M) Prognostic \u2013 includes anatomic TNM plus tumor grade The prognostic stage also includes the assumption that you are treated with the standard-of-care approaches Prognostic stages are divided into clinical and pathologic Cancer staging is often done twice, before and after surgery Staging after surgery provides more specific and accurate details about the size of the cancer and lymph node status Clinical stage Clinical stage (c) is the rating given before any treatment It is based on a physical exam, biopsy, and imaging tests An example might look like cN2 or cMIn throat cancer, the clinical (before surgery) stage is based on imaging results These tests are done before any treatment as part of an initial diagnosis Surgery is needed to know exactly how much cancer is in the body Pathologic stage Pathologic stage (p) or surgical stage is determined by examining tissue removed during surgery An example might be pNIf you are given a cancer drug therapy before surgery, then the stage might add a \"y\" and look like ypTThe pathologic (after surgery) stage is based on information gained after surgery to remove all or part of the tumor and nearby lymph nodes This gives a more accurate picture of how far the cancer has spread and is used to determine your treatment options after surgery The removal of tumor tissue and nearby lymph nodes is an important part of pathologic staging Lymph nodes in the head and neck There are over 300 lymph nodes in the head and neck Most throat tumors spread to nearby lymph nodes TNM scores The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system is used to stage throat cancer In this system, the letters T, N, and M describe different areas of cancer growth Based on imaging and pathology results, a score or number is assigned to each letter The higher the number, the larger the tumor or the more the cancer has spread These scores will be combined to assign the cancer a stage A TNM example might look like this: T1N0M0 or T1, N0, M T (tumor) \u2013 Depth and size of the main (primary) tumor N (node) \u2013 If cancer has spread to nearby (regional) lymph nodes M (metastasis) \u2013 If cancer has spread to distant parts of the body or metastasized Throat cancer stages are based on if the cancer is p16-positive or p16-negative (p16-) A p cancer is one that is HPVrelated (HPV-mediated) Numbered stages Numbered stages are based on TNM scores Stages range from stage 0 to stage 4, with 4 being the most advanced They might be written as stage 0, stage I, stage II, stage III, and stage IV Other terms might be used instead of numbered cancer stages Resectable \u2013 Tumor can be removed completely with surgery Unresectable \u2013 Tumor cannot be removed completely with surgery The tumor might involve nearby veins and arteries or other structures making it unsafe to remove Locoregional or locally advanced \u2013 This refers to a tumor that has spread to tissue, organs, or lymph nodes in the head and neck Moderately

tested to look for specific DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) mutations/alterations, protein levels, or other molecular features This information is used to choose the best treatment for you It is sometimes called molecular testing or tumor profiling, tumor sequencing, gene expression profiling, or genomic testing Biomarker testing includes tests of genes or their products (proteins) It identifies the presence or absence of mutations and certain proteins that might suggest treatment Proteins are written like this: BRCA Genes are written with italics like this: BRCA HER2 and hormone receptor status are part of biomarker testing Your treatment team will recommend the best types of biomarker testing that are important for you Tumor markers Your blood or biopsy tissue may be tested for proteins Examples of some tumor markers in breast cancer include carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), CA 15-3, and CA An increase in the level of certain tumor markers could mean that the cancer has grown or spread (progressed) However, not everyone has elevated levels of these markers and tumor markers alone are not a reliable method of detecting breast cancer Tumor mutational burden When there are 10 or more mutations per million base pairs of tumor DNA, it is called tumor mutational burden-high (TMB-H) TMB-H can be used to help predict response to cancer treatment using immune checkpoint inhibitors that target the proteins called programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) Tumor mutation testing A sample of your tumor or blood may be used to see if the cancer cells have any specific DNA mutations This is a different type of DNA testing than the genetic testing for mutations you may have inherited from your parents In tumor mutation testing, only the tumor is tested and not the rest of your body Certain mutations such as PIK3CA can be targeted with specific therapies MSI-H/dMMR mutation Microsatellites are short, repeated strings of DNA When errors or defects occur, they are fixed by mismatch repair (MMR) proteins Some cancers have DNA mutations for changes that prevent these errors from being fixed This is called microsatellite instability (MSI) or deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) When cancer cells have more than a normal number of microsatellites, it is called MSI-H (microsatellite instability-high) This is often due to dMMR genes PD-1 and PD-L1 testing Programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) are immune proteins If either protein is expressed on the surface of cancer cells, it can cause your immune cells to ignore the cancer and suppress the anti-tumor immune response If your cancer expresses either protein, you might have treatment that combines chemotherapy and a checkpoint inhibitor therapy This is designed to activate your immune system to better fight off the cancer cells FISH Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a testing method that involves special dyes called probes that attach to pieces of DNA, the genetic material in a person\u2019s cells Immunohistochemistry Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a special staining process that involves adding a chemical marker to cancer or immune cells The cells are then studied using a microscope Next-generation sequencing Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a highthroughput method used to determine the DNA sequence or gene changes of cancer cells in your tumor This method would only be used if enough tumor tissue remains after other biomarker testing has been completed PCR A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a lab process that can make millions or billions of copies of your DNA (genetic information) PCR is very sensitive It can find 1 abnormal cell among more than 100,000 normal cells These copies called PCR product might be used for NGS Genetic risk testing About 1 out of 10 breast cancers are hereditary Depending on your family history or other features of your cancer, your health care provider might refer you for hereditary genetic testing to learn more about your cancer A genetic counselor or trained provider will speak to you about the results Tests results may be used to guide treatment planning Genetic testing is done using blood or saliva (spitting into a cup or a cheek swab) The goal is to look for gene mutations inherited from your biological parents called germline mutations Some mutations can put you at

also used for actinic keratoses (pre-cancerous lesions) that are in the same general area as the Bowen\u2019s lesion Photodynamic therapy In photodynamic therapy (PDT), a lightsensitive drug is applied to the area When exposed to light (either red or blue light in the doctor\u2019s office, or shaded outdoor light), the drug becomes active and kills cancer cells Photodynamic therapy A drug applied to the skin becomes active and kills cancer cells when exposed to light Common side effects of PDT include itching or burning when the liquid is applied, pain during the red or blue light exposure, and itching and redness for a few days after treatment Cryotherapy Cryotherapy (also called cryosurgery) freezes and destroys precancerous and cancerous cells using a very cold liquid or tool Liquid nitrogen is often used Cryotherapy sometimes causes a burning sensation during treatment A blister and scab will form, which heals over 2 to 3 weeks Skin darkening or lightening can happen while it is healing Topical therapies Topical therapies are treatments that are applied to the skin. 5-fluorouracil (Carac, Efudex, Fluoroplex) and imiquimod (Aldara) are prescription creams used to treat early CSCC and actinic keratoses. 5-fluorouracil (also called 5-FU) is chemotherapy applied directly to the skin, unlike most chemotherapy that is put into the bloodstream A cream called calcipotriene (Sorilux, Dovonex) is often used with 5-fluorouracil to treat actinic keratosis Calcipotriene is a form of vitamin D that activates the skin\u2019s immune system Imiquimod belongs to a group of drugs known as immune response modifiers This cream can help fight abnormal skin growths by activating the immune system to damage abnormal skin cells Tirbanibulin (Klisyri) is another topical therapy used to treat actinic keratosis Tirbanibulin is a type of medication called a microtubule inhibitor It works by killing fast-growing cells, such as the abnormal cells that cause actinic keratoses It is applied to the face or scalp 1 time a day for 5 days in a row (consecutive) using a single-dose packet with each application Thickening of the outer layer of skin is known as

those living with cancer are living better, longer lives thanks to the power of research and advancements in treatment.\u201d PSA level doesn\u2019t tell the whole story, though There are other ways that PSA can be interpreted, such as PSA density PSA density If you have a larger prostate, you\u2019re also likely to have a higher PSA level But that doesn\u2019t mean you have a greater risk for prostate cancer To adjust for this, care providers calculate PSA density PSA density is the amount of PSA compared to the size of the prostate PSA density is calculated by dividing the PSA level by the prostate size The size of the prostate is measured by transrectal ultrasound or MRI scan A higher PSA density (above 15 ng/ mL\u00b2, for example) indicates a greater likelihood of cancer PSA density also accounts for those with small and very small prostates, who could have prostate cancer even with low PSAs Grade Group If cancer cells are found in your biopsy samples, further testing can identify your cancer risk Results from these tests may indicate that the cancer will grow and spread quickly, for example Or the results may suggest that the cancer will grow very slowly and not spread outside of the prostate at all This information helps plan the best treatment for your type of cancer By looking at your biopsy samples, the pathologist will identify certain cancer cell patterns (called Gleason patterns), which are used to calculate your Gleason score, which translates to your Grade Group, which estimates your risk This can be confusing at first (Gleason patterns Gleason score Grade Group?) but it\u2019s not all that complicated in the end Read on Gleason patterns After studying your biopsy sample under a microscope, the pathologist will assign a number based on the \u201cpattern\u201d of cancer cells (Gleason pattern) in the sample A cancer cell pattern that looks more like normal and healthy cells is given a lower number A cell pattern that looks more abnormal is assigned a higher number Gleason patterns range from 1 to However, patterns 1 and 2 are so rarely found that they are no longer used So the lowest (most normal) pattern number is Gleason score If prostate tumors contained only one pattern of cancer cells, estimating risk would be much easier But prostate biopsies often contain more than one pattern of cells To account for this, the two most common Gleason patterns found in the biopsy sample are combined into a single Gleason score The pattern of cancer cells that takes up the largest area in the sample is assigned the first number The pattern that accounts for the secondlargest area is given the second number Add these two numbers together and you get a Gleason score For example: pattern pattern Gleason score of 7 A Gleason score represents how much your biopsy sample looks like normal prostate tissue It also estimates how aggressive your prostate cancer is\u2014how quickly it might grow and whether it will spread A higher Gleason score means the cancer is more likely to grow and spread quickly than a cancer with a lower Gleason score Gleason scores range from 6 to 10, where 6 is the lowest score A Gleason score of 7 is intermediate-grade, and 8 to 10 is high-grade This can be confusing because 6 seems like it would be a medium score, not a low score So to make Gleason scores simpler to use,

genetic syndromes means you are at higher risk of getting squamous cell skin cancer While there are many, these syndromes include: h Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), a condition in which the body isn\u2019t able to repair damage to DNA caused by sunlight Skin cells with a lot of DNA damage can eventually become skin cancers Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB), a form of a rare, inherited skin disorder that causes the skin to become very fragile Any trauma to the skin can cause painful blisters NCCN recommends that people with these or other genetic syndromes should be referred to a cancer center with expertise in CSCC prevention and treatment NCCN also recommends that those with a genetic risk of skin cancer receive counseling from someone with expertise in cancer genetics throughout the treatment process This might be a genetic counselor, medical geneticist, endocrinologist, oncologist, surgeon, or an oncology nurse Weakened immune system When your immune system is weakened, your body has trouble fighting off viruses, bacteria, and fungi This can lead to infections and other health risks Having a weakened immune system can put you at risk of squamous cell skin cancer An example of when this happens is after organ transplantation If you received an organ from another person, you likely take drugs to stop your body from attacking the donated organ These drugs, called immunosuppressants, also reduce the body\u2019s ability to fight infection and disease The immune system also may not work well if you have other health conditions, such as: Lymphoma (cancer of the lymph nodes) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cancer of white blood cells in bone marrow) Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or AIDS Any of these conditions can weaken the immune system, which can increase the risk of getting squamous cell skin cancer Everyone with this condition should undergo skin cancer screening on a regular basis Diagnosis If you have an area of abnormal-looking skin (called a lesion) that looks like it could be skin cancer, the next step is testing This will likely include: h A full health history A close examination of the lesion(s) A skin biopsy to remove a sample of the lesion and test it for cancer (this is the only way to know for sure if there\u2019s cancer) Imaging scans if cancer may be deep within the skin or spread to other parts of the body Biopsy If a concerning lesion is found on your skin, some or all of it will be removed and sent to a lab to be looked at under a microscope This is called a skin biopsy A biopsy is needed to diagnose squamous cell skin cancer Your sample should be reviewed by a pathologist The pathologist will note the overall appearance and the size, shape, and type of your cells There are several ways to do a skin biopsy Your doctor will choose one based on the size of the affected area, where it is on your body, and other factors Any biopsy is likely to leave at least a small scar Different methods can result in different types of scars Talk to your doctor about the type of biopsy and the risk of scarring before you have the biopsy No matter which type of biopsy is done, it

early or locally advanced What is NSCLC Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a type of lung cancer Another type of lung cancer is small cell lung cancer, but it is a different cancer covered in another book Lung cancer cells grow out of control They don\u2019t die when they should and make many new cancer cells, which become tumors Lung cancer cells also don\u2019t stay in place They can break away from a tumor, spread outside the lung, and form more tumors NSCLC is a type of lung carcinoma Almost all lung cancers are carcinomas (karsin-OH-mas) Lung carcinomas form from cells that line the airways of the lungs The airways inside the lungs are the bronchi, bronchioli, and alveoli NSCLC is the most common lung carcinoma Other lung carcinomas are neuroendocrine tumors Information on lung neuroendocrine tumors can be found at Airways of the lungs The air you breathe moves through a series of airways It travels down your throat and through your windpipe (trachea) The windpipe splits into two airways called bronchi Inside the lung, each bronchus divides into smaller airways called the bronchioli At the end of the bronchioli are sacs called alveoli Oxygen is transferred from air into the blood in the alveoli NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app There are several types of NSCLC Each type of NSCLC forms from a particular kind of cell Below are common types of NSCLC: Adenocarcinoma (A-deh-noh-KAR-sihNOH-muh) often forms from cells that line the alveoli and make mucus This is the most common type of NSCLC Large cell carcinoma forms from any of the large cells that are found throughout the airways Squamous cell carcinoma (squaymous) forms from cells that line the bronchi What is early and locally advanced NSCLC Early and locally advanced lung cancers have not spread to the tissue lining around the lung or to other organs The difference between early and locally advanced cancer is mainly based on the cancer stage Cancer stages 1, 2, and 3 A cancer stage describes the extent of lung cancer in the body The main stages of NCCN Guidelines for Patients\u00ae Early and Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 2024 Cancers that have spread to the lungs are not lung cancers For example, stomach cancer that has spread to the lungs is still stomach cancer. lung cancer are often written with Roman numerals\u2014stages I (1), II (2), III (3), and IV (4) We will be listing stages as 1, 2, 3, and 4 to make the stages easier to read At diagnosis, stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3 cancers have grown from the airway into lung tissue Some have spread to nearby diseasefighting structures called lymph nodes Stage 1 is early NSCLC In general, stage 2 and stage 3 are considered locally advanced Cancer stages and metastasis Some early and locally advanced cancers spread to the tissue lining around the lung or to other organs after diagnosis and then are called metastatic cancer Stage 4 cancer is metastatic cancer at the time of diagnosis Information about metastatic NSCLC is available at NCCN.org/patientguidelines and on the NCCN Patient Guides for Cancer app What\u2019s the best treatment There\u2019s no single treatment

treatment options for the most common types of cervical cancer Surgery is usually recommended for earlystage cancers, while most locally advanced cancers are treated with chemoradiation This section applies to the following types of cervical cancer: Squamous cell carcinoma Adenocarcinoma Adenosquamous carcinoma Treatment is based on the cancer stage The stage describes how far the cancer has likely spread based on imaging and other testing A risk factor that guides treatment for cervical cancer is lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) LVSI means that there are tumor cells in the blood vessels or lymph vessels inside the tumor Cancers with LVSI are more likely to spread to nearby lymph nodes Nearby lymph nodes are more likely to be removed Fertility-sparing treatment Surgical treatment for early-stage cervical cancer often involves surgery that removes the uterus (hysterectomy) Carrying a pregnancy is not possible after a hysterectomy If the cancer has not spread beyond the cervix (stage 1), fertility-sparing treatment may be an option, if desired This approach involves surgery that does not remove the uterus or ovaries, allowing you the option of natural pregnancy in the future If fertility-sparing treatment is being considered, ask your doctor about getting the opinion of a reproductive endocrinologist Reproductive endocrinologists are doctors that specialize in fertility A fertility-sparing approach is not appropriate for some uncommon types of cervical cancer Stage 1A1 Cone biopsy is recommended for stage 1A1 cancers without known LVSI If the results are good, no further treatment is needed If the results suggest that the cancer was not completely removed, you may have another cone biopsy Or, your doctor may recommend radical trachelectomy For stage 1A1 cancers with LVSI, treatment with either cone biopsy or radical trachelectomy is recommended Pelvic lymph node evaluation should also be performed If trachelectomy is planned, see the next page for information on treatment after surgery Stage 1A2 Cone biopsy is an option for some very-lowrisk stage 1A2 cancers The tumor must be smaller than 2 centimeters, there must be no LVSI, and other criteria must be met Pelvic lymph node evaluation is performed in addition to the cone biopsy For stage 1A2 cancers with LVSI, treatment with either cone biopsy or radical trachelectomy is recommended Pelvic lymph node evaluation is also performed If trachelectomy is planned, see the next page for information on treatment after surgery Stage 1B1 Cone biopsy is an option for some very-lowrisk stage 1B1 cancers The tumor must be smaller than 2 cm, there must be no LVSI, and other criteria must be met Pelvic lymph node evaluation is also performed For stage 1B1 cancers that do not meet the criteria for cone biopsy, radical trachelectomy with pelvic lymph node evaluation is recommended Lymph nodes in the abdomen (para-aortic nodes) may be removed in addition to pelvic lymph nodes Stage 1B2 Fertility-sparing surgery is not performed often for stage 1B2 cancers Because most research on fertility-sparing surgery applies to smaller tumors, abdominal surgery is generally preferred Treatment after surgery If testing finds no cancer in tissue beyond the cervix or in lymph nodes removed during surgery, there are 2 options External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is recommended for cancers with risk factors Observation is recommended for cancers without risk factors Your doctor will consider the tumor size, whether there is LVSI, and other factors when determining if EBRT is a good choice for you If EBRT is planned, platinum chemotherapy may be given during the same time period This is called chemoradiation If cancer is found in any pelvic or paraaortic lymph nodes, or in any tissues outside the cervix, treatment with chemoradiation is recommended Vaginal brachytherapy may be given in addition to EBRT and platinum chemotherapy Fertility-sparing treatment Fertility-sparing treatment may be an option, if desired, for some stage 1 cancers This approach involves surgery that does not remove the uterus or ovaries, allowing you the option of natural pregnancy in the future Early-stage cancer The treatment options in this section apply to: Cancers that are only in the cervix (stage 1) Cancers that have spread to the upper vagina (stage 2A) Surgery

of organs found behind the other organs in your abdomen Each kidney is about the size of an adult\u2019s fist The kidney is covered by a thin layer of tissue, like the skin of an apple This layer of tissue is called the renal capsule Renal refers to the kidney The kidneys are part of the urinary system The urinary system is a group of organs that remove waste from the body in the form of urine (or pee) This system includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra The kidneys make hormones that help control blood pressure They also make hormones that tell the body to make more red blood cells By filtering the blood, the kidneys also control and balance the levels of fluids and chemicals in your body The kidneys and urinary system The kidneys are the main organs of the urinary system The ureters, bladder, and urethra hold and transport urine before it is released from the body An adrenal gland sits on top of each kidney The kidney and adrenal gland are surrounded by a layer of fat Covering the fat is an outer layer of fibrous tissue called Gerota\u2019s fascia When kidney cancer grows into and beyond Gerota\u2019s fascia, it is a sign of advanced kidney cancer How the kidneys work The kidneys perform many jobs to keep your body healthy The main job of the kidneys is to filter blood to remove waste and extra water from the body By filtering the blood, the kidneys also control and balance the levels of fluids and chemicals in your body The renal artery carries blood with waste into the kidney Blood then flows through tiny filtering tubes in the kidney called renal tubules Blood is cleaned as it flows through the renal tubules The renal tubules remove waste and other substances from the blood These substances are made into urine The clean, filtered blood flows out of the kidney through the renal vein The renal vein merges with a larger vein called the vena cava The vena cava takes clean blood back up to the heart Urine flows out of the renal tubules and collects in a hollow space in the middle of the kidney called the renal pelvis Urine leaves the renal pelvis through a long tube called the The kidneys filter blood to remove waste Blood enters the kidney through the renal artery Renal tubules remove excess water and other waste from the blood to make urine Urine drips out of the renal tubules into the renal pelvis, then leaves the kidney through the ureter Clean, filtered blood leaves the kidney through the renal vein. ureter The ureter carries urine to the bladder The bladder holds urine until it is released from the body when you urinate (or pee) A shorter tube, called the urethra, takes urine from the bladder to outside the body Most people have two kidneys However, each kidney works on its own and does not need the other to function This means that the body can often work well with less than one complete kidney Many people live full, healthy lives with only one kidney Kidney cancer Kidney cancer starts in the tissues of the kidneys Almost all kidney cancers are carcinomas Carcinomas are cancers that start in cells that line the inner or outer surfaces of the body In the kidneys, carcinomas most often start in the cells that line the renal tubules This is called renal cell carcinoma (RCC) About 9 out of 10 kidney cancers are RCCs RCC may appear as multiple tumors in one kidney or involve both kidneys Because it is the most common type, RCC is often simply referred to as kidney cancer RCC is the focus of this book There are other, less common cancers that can arise in the kidney While they can sometimes be confused with RCC, it is important to note that they are treated differently Urothelial carcinoma starts in the cells that line the renal pelvis and ureter that drain the kidney",

pain, burning, stinging, loss of feeling or movement, and double or blurred vision Tumor grade The tumor grade is a rating of how fast your doctors expect the cancer to grow and spread It is based on how different the tumor cells look compared to normal cells under a microscope The more different they look, the higher the risk of spreading Tumor type To diagnose squamous cell skin cancer, you likely had a small sample of tissue removed for testing (a skin biopsy) That tissue sample was then analyzed by a pathologist in order to determine the specific type (and subtype) of cancer There are certain rare subtypes of squamous cell skin cancer that are more likely to return after treatment Connective tissue in the tumor Some tumors form fibrous or connective tissue, which is a sign of a high-risk or very high-risk cancer How deep the tumor is The deeper the tumor has invaded into the skin, the higher the risk of the cancer returning after treatment or spreading to distant sites Cancer cells in lymph or blood vessels If there are cancer cells in the blood vessels or lymph vessels outside of the main tumor, it means that the cancer is more likely to spread to nearby lymph nodes and other parts of the body This is known as lymphovascular invasion Weakened immune system People with a weakened immune system have a higher risk of getting CSCC, and they are at higher risk of cancer returning after treatment Examples of conditions that weaken the immune system include long-term corticosteroid use, having human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or AIDS, or having received an organ transplant Low-risk Surgery is the preferred treatment for low-risk CSCC that has not spread to lymph nodes The options for surgery include: Curettage and electrodesiccation (C&E) or shave excision Standard surgical excision Mohs surgery or another form of PDEMA If you are not a candidate for surgery, treatment with radiation therapy is recommended if you can have it Curettage and electrodesiccation C&E or shave excision are recommended treatment options for low-risk, local CSCC Usually it is considered for early, small CSCC on the surface of the skin If the tumor ends up being deeper than expected into the skin during the procedure, a standard surgical or shave excision should be performed rather than C&E to remove deep areas of cancerous tissue Standard surgical excision Standard surgical excision is a recommended treatment option for low-risk, local CSCC If testing after surgery finds cancer cells in the surrounding tissue removed with the tumor, more treatment is needed Further treatment options include: Mohs surgery or resection with PDEMA Another surgical excision Radiation therapy (if more surgery cannot be done) Mohs surgery or PDEMA Mohs surgery or another form of PDEMA is a recommended treatment option for low-risk CSCC that has not spread to lymph nodes. \uf0dc See Part 2: Types of treatment for more detailed descriptions of these treatments

tests A genetic test is used to find abnormal changes in your genes Genes are small segments of DNA inside every cell Genes provide the instructions to tell the cell how to make proteins, which carry out a lot of important functions in the body Once in a while, a gene will have or develop an abnormal change (mutation) A mutation is when something is different in your genes than in most other people\u2019s genes Sometimes an abnormal change can cause a gene to make the wrong type of protein or make no protein at all This abnormality could affect the cell, which may in turn cause a disease such as cancer Mutations can be passed down in families, in which case they occur in every cell in your body Or mutations can occur spontaneously in just some of your cells In other words, they may be present before you\u2019re born (called an inherited or germline mutation) or occur on their own later in life (called an acquired or somatic mutation) The two basic types of genetic tests used for prostate cancer care are germline testing and molecular biomarker testing: Germline testing Sometimes, mutations in genes inherited from your parents can increase the risk of different cancers You can pass these genes on to your children Other family members might also carry these mutations If you have a family history of cancer, your doctor might suggest genetic germline testing to find out if you have an inherited cancer risk The goal of this type of genetic testing is to look for germline (inherited) mutations that occur in every cell in your body Genetic germline testing is done using a sample of your blood, urine, or saliva For prostate cancer, germline testing looks for characteristic changes in these genes: BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, CHEK2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PALB2, PMS2, and others Some mutations can put you at risk for more than one type of cancer Germline mutations in genes like BRCA1 or BRCA2 are also related to breast cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, and skin cancer (melanoma) Germline mutations in MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, and PMS2 are related to colorectal and uterine cancers in addition to prostate cancer If a germline mutation is suspected based on your family\u2019s or your own health history, you should ask about testing Your doctor can talk to you about testing or refer you to a genetic counselor A genetic counselor is an expert who has special training in genetic diseases A genetic counselor can help you decide whether you would like to undergo germline testing and help you interpret the results of these tests Germline testing is recommended for those with prostate cancer and any of the following: Family members or relatives who have or had prostate cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, intestinal cancer, and certain other cancers Family history

Having any other type of cancer Talk to your medical providers and/or a genetic counselor about your family history of cancer Molecular biomarker testing In biomarker testing, a sample from your biopsy is tested to look at its molecular components This information helps figure out how likely your cancer could spread to other parts of the body Biomarker testing can be considered for those with localized, regional, or metastatic prostate cancer Biomarker testing is sometimes called genomic testing, tumor profiling, or molecular tumor testing The main reason to have a molecular biomarker test is to help assess whether you have lower risk or higher risk prostate cancer If you have lower risk cancer, you may be able to avoid or delay treatment such as surgery or radiation therapy, which means you\u2019d also avoid or delay any treatment-related complications and side effects At the same time, a molecular biomarker test can flag those who have higher risk prostate cancer, which may

follow-up exam with DRE is recommended 8 to 12 weeks after completing chemoradiation to check the results of treatment Surveillance during remission includes DRE and lymph node exams every 3 to 6 months for 5 years and anoscopy every 6 to 12 months for 3 years Yearly imaging for 3 years is also recommended for stage II and III anal cancers APR surgery to remove the anus may be needed for anal cancer that does not respond to initial treatment or that returns after treatment It involves creating a permanent colostomy for stool to leave the body If cancer returns to lymph nodes in the groin (but not to the anal area) and you had radiation as part of initial treatment, a groin dissection and/or chemotherapy is recommended Metastatic anal cancer is treated with chemotherapy If the cancer does not respond or gets worse, immunotherapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor is recommended if you are eligible Clinical trials provide access to investigational treatments that may, in time, be approved by the U.S FDA. 3 Survivorship 32 Your primary care doctor 32 Late and long-term side effects 36 Healthy habits 37 More information 3 Survivorship Survivorship focuses on the physical, emotional, and financial issues unique to cancer survivors Managing the long-term side effects of cancer and its treatment, staying connected with your primary care doctor, and living a healthy lifestyle are important parts of survivorship Anal cancer survivors may experience both short- and long-term health effects of cancer and its treatment These effects are different for everyone and depend on the treatment(s) received Your primary care doctor After finishing cancer treatment, your primary care doctor, also known as a general practitioner (GP) or primary care physician (PCP), will play an important role in your care Your oncologist (cancer doctor) and PCP should work together to make sure you get the follow-up care you need Your oncologist will develop a written survivorship care plan that includes: A summary of your cancer treatment history, including surgeries, radiation treatments, and chemotherapy A description of possible short-term, late, and long-term side effects Recommendations for monitoring for the return of cancer Information on when your care will be transferred to your PCP Your primary care doctor Clear roles and responsibilities for both your cancer care team and your PCP Recommendations on your overall health and well-being Late and long-term side effects Some side effects of anal cancer treatment can linger longer than expected Others may not

Ovary preservation The ovaries may or may not be removed during hysterectomy If you have not entered menopause, surgery that removes both ovaries will cause menopause This is referred to as surgical menopause It is caused by the sudden drop in estrogen in the body There are shortand long-term symptoms and risks of surgical menopause that can greatly affect quality of life When caused by surgery, the symptoms of menopause may be sudden and more severe Symptoms include hot flashes, sleeping problems, night sweats, weight gain, and changes in mood Vaginal atrophy is another common symptom Vaginal atrophy is a condition in which the lining of the vagina becomes thin, dry, and inflamed Longterm risks of not having enough estrogen include cardiovascular disease and bone loss (osteoporosis) If hysterectomy is being considered, ask your doctor if keeping your ovaries is appropriate Lymph node dissection Cancer cells can travel through blood and lymph Lymph is a clear fluid that carries infection-fighting white blood cells Lymph nodes are bean-shaped glands found throughout the body They contain immune cells that help the body fight infection and disease During surgery for cervical cancer, lymph nodes may be removed in order to be tested for cancer This is called lymph node dissection or lymphadenectomy In order to identify and remove the lymph node(s) most likely to contain cancer, a sentinel lymph node biopsy may be performed This involves injecting a special dye or a radioactive substance into the cervix near the cancer Lymph nodes containing the dye or substance can be seen using a special camera These are the sentinel nodes They are removed and tested for cancer Testing the removed nodes helps determine the extent (spread) of the cancer Removing lymph nodes can also help limit the spread of cancer cells through lymph The closest lymph nodes to the cervix are the pelvic nodes Cervical cancer generally spreads to these nodes first Lymph nodes in the abdomen, called the para-aortic nodes, are also sometimes removed Pre-treatment surgical staging If the cancer has spread beyond the cervix, a hysterectomy is not performed but pelvic and/ or para-aortic lymph nodes may be removed and tested before any treatment is given Knowing whether pelvic or para-aortic nodes contain cancer can help guide treatment decisions for more advanced cancers A minimally invasive approach is typically used to access and remove the lymph nodes This is referred to as laparoscopic surgical staging External beam radiation therapy Radiation therapy uses high-energy waves similar to x-rays to kill cancer cells In external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), a large machine aims radiation at the cancer site The radiation passes through skin and other tissue to reach the tumor and nearby lymph nodes EBRT is given in small doses, called fractions An advanced type of EBRT called intensitymodulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is often used to treat cervical cancer IMRT uses many small beams of different strengths This allows a high dose of radiation to reach the tumor while limiting the amount of radiation to the surrounding normal tissue With IMRT it is possible to reduce radiation to important nearby organs and structures, such as the bowel, bladder, external genitalia, and hip joints This can help reduce treatment-related side effects Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a highly specialized type of EBRT used to treat metastatic cervical cancer High doses of radiation are delivered to tumors in the liver, lungs, or bone using very precise beams Treatment is typically delivered in 5 or fewer sessions Side effects Common side effects during the 5 to 6 weeks of EBRT include fatigue, skin redness and irritation, diarrhea, nausea, and frequent or painful urination Most of these side effects develop gradually They increase during treatment and gradually decrease once treatment is over When the ovaries are included in the radiation field, it causes premature (early) menopause The symptoms are similar to those caused by surgical menopause, as described above Ovarian transposition is a surgery that moves one or both

You\u2019ll be given anesthesia to numb the pain or to make you fall asleep The urologist will insert a lubricated probe into your rectum The probe provides a visual image of the prostate The urologist will then insert a hollow needle into the prostate gland using the video display to guide it The needle is inserted either through the perineum (the skin between the anus and scrotum) or through the rectum When the urologist removes the needle, it will pull out a small sample of prostate tissue called a core A core sample is only about 1 to 2 millimeters wide and 12 to 20 millimeters long\u2014about as wide as a toothpick and as long as a raisin The urologist will usually take 12 or more core samples from different parts of the prostate Checking different areas provides a more complete evaluation of cancer throughout the gland After the biopsy samples are removed, a specialist called a pathologist will examine the samples under a microscope and test them for cancer cells The pathologist will find out how many of the core samples contain cancer and will also measure the percentage of cancer in each core With this information, the pathologist can estimate the amount of cancer in the prostate and how aggressive it may be Also, by knowing where each core sample was taken, the pathologist can tell if the cancer is concentrated in a certain section of the prostate The pathologist will put these results into a report Ask your doctor or another member of Biopsy of the prostate A biopsy removes a sample of tissue that is tested for cancer This is a transperineal

holds urine What causes prostate cancer Many people who develop prostate cancer wonder where it came from and how they got it Cancer researchers don\u2019t know exactly what causes prostate cells to grow out of control (become cancerous) The fact is, everyone with a prostate has a risk of getting prostate cancer But several factors are linked to a higher risk of prostate cancer These are called risk factors A risk factor is anything that increases your chance of getting cancer Risk factors don\u2019t necessarily cause prostate cancer, but people with prostate cancer usually have one or more of these risk factors: Age The biggest risk factor for prostate cancer is age Prostate cancer is diagnosed most often in those aged 65 years and above Your chances of getting prostate cancer increase as you become older Family history Your family health history is information about the diseases and health conditions in your family A family history reflects a pattern of certain diseases among family members Having a close family member with prostate cancer (a sibling or parent) increases the chance of getting it yourself Those with a family history of certain other cancers (breast, ovarian, colon, pancreatic, and other cancers) may also be at a higher risk for prostate cancer Genetic factors When cancer \u201cruns in the family,\u201d genetic testing can be done to find specific genetic changes (mutations) known to be linked with prostate cancer or other cancers For instance, having an inherited genetic change in the BRCA2 gene increases the risk of getting prostate cancer But genetic abnormalities that aren\u2019t inherited can occur, too Race In the United States, Black males are more likely than white males to develop prostate cancer Prostate cancer in Black males is also more likely to occur at an earlier age and be more aggressive and more advanced when diagnosed Black males are also twice as likely to die from prostate cancer compared with white males Prostate cancer is diagnosed less often in Hispanic and Asian males than in white and Black males Several things may contribute to these differences, such as barriers to accessing health care (including early detection screening), biological and genetic factors, and other causes Specialists are researching each of these areas In light of these issues, Black males may want to talk with their health care providers about getting screening tests earlier than what\u2019s recommended for other males What does aggressive mean When health care professionals describe cancer as aggressive, they mean the cancer is likely to grow or spread more rapidly than average Aggressive is also used to describe therapy that\u2019s stronger or more intense than other treatment options Diet and lifestyle No one particular diet has been found to prevent prostate cancer or to cause prostate cancer However, eating food that\u2019s high in fat, such as meat and dairy products, has been linked with an increased risk of prostate cancer Eating more fruits and vegetables may reduce this risk Exercise and losing weight may also decrease the aggressiveness of prostate cancer and the likelihood of dying from it On the other hand, smoking and obesity increase the risks of developing and dying from prostate cancer What is early-stage prostate cancer Prostate cancer can be grouped into earlystage cancer or advanced-stage cancer Early stage Early-stage prostate cancer has not spread beyond the prostate The cancer usually grows slowly and stays in the prostate Cancer that is contained entirely within the prostate is called localized prostate cancer This book is all about early-stage (localized) prostate cancer Advanced stage Advanced stage means that cancer cells have spread outside the prostate to other areas in the body This spreading is called metastasis or metastatic cancer Metastatic prostate cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, bones, liver, lungs, and other organs Advanced-stage prostate cancer can be separated into two types: Cancer that grows from the prostate gland to nearby lymph nodes, but no farther, is called regional prostate cancer.

IsoPSA, among others Some of the urine tests include ExoDx, miR Sentinel, MPS, PCA3, and SelectMDx Diagnostic tests If the PSA test, digital rectal exam, blood or urine tests, or other factors (like family history, race, or age) suggest you may have prostate cancer, you\u2019ll be offered diagnostic testing Talk with your doctor about whether a biopsy or imaging should be the next test you take Imaging tests An imaging test takes pictures (images) of the insides of your body The images can reveal cancer, including its size, location, and other features such as the size of the prostate itself The images may show where the cancer started (primary tumor) and whether the cancer has spread (metastasized) Imaging is also used after cancer treatment to see how well it worked and to check if the cancer comes back Imaging can come before, during, or after a biopsy. h Before \u2013 Imaging is sometimes ordered beforehand to find out if a biopsy is truly necessary During \u2013 Imaging is used during a biopsy to guide the removal of tissue samples After \u2013 Imaging may come after a biopsy to see the size and location of the cancer, which helps to plan treatment Imaging methods for detecting prostate cancer include MRI, CT, PET, ultrasound, bone scan, or a combination of these After your scan, your images will be studied by a radiologist A radiologist is a doctor who\u2019s an expert in reading imaging tests The radiologist will send the results to your doctor This information helps your doctor plan the next steps of your care Your doctor will discuss the results with you Be sure to ask any questions you may have Imaging may not be needed for early-stage prostate cancer If your PSA, digital rectal exam, and prostate biopsy results indicate that your risk is low for the cancer to metastasize (spread beyond the prostate), then you may not need imaging tests at this time Your team may recommend one or more of the following imaging tests to look for cancer growth: MRI scan A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan uses radio waves and powerful magnets to take pictures of the inside of the body An MRI can provide a detailed view of the cancer within the prostate It\u2019s also used to see if cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes or to the bones in your pelvis MRI may be used before a biopsy to target areas suspicious for cancer Or it may be used after diagnosis to figure out whether the cancer has advanced outside the prostate or into the lymph nodes It can help to plan treatment or to decide whether active surveillance is appropriate",

Molecular biomarker testing is discussed further in Chapter What\u2019s next After you\u2019ve had all these tests to find out if you have prostate cancer, your care team will put together all your test results to figure out whether your prostate cancer is lower risk or higher risk Once your level of risk has been identified, your team will assess whether you need treatment and, if so, what your treatment plan will be Key points An unusually high amount of PSA in the bloodstream may be a sign of prostate cancer. h A digital rectal exam is the simplest way to check the size and texture of your

team will look at several key characteristics to assess your risk This chapter explains each of these characteristics After being told you have cancer, your next thought may be, \u201cHow soon can I start treatment to get rid of it?\u201d The fact is, a lot of patients with early-stage prostate cancer don\u2019t need treatment right away Many never need treatment Figuring out whether someone needs treatment and which treatment to use requires an assessment of their risks A risk assessment is a process for identifying potential problems and then considering what would happen if those problems occurred In the case of early-stage prostate cancer, a risk assessment considers how likely the cancer is to remain within the prostate or to spread to outside the prostate A risk assessment also considers whether the cancer may come back after treatment (recurrence) and, if so, whether it can be controlled with a different type of treatment To assess risk, your care providers use these tools: risk groups, life expectancy, nomograms, and molecular biomarker tests Although you may not receive all of them, let\u2019s look at each of these assessment tools in turn: Risk groups Your care team will look at the clinical characteristics of your cancer, such as your prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, biopsy results, and other test results From this information, your providers can classify your disease into one of five different risk groups, from very low risk to very high risk Why do you need to know your risk group Because your risk group is the basis for your prognosis A prognosis predicts the likely course and outcome of a disease Your prognosis guides your treatment options For example, patients with lower risk generally get minimal treatment or no treatment at all Patients with higher risk usually get more aggressive treatment Test results and calculations\u2014PSA level, Grade Group, tumor stage, and biopsy results\u2014are put together to determine your risk group PSA level A simple blood test will tell you how much prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is in your bloodstream A high PSA level may indicate a risk for prostate cancer However, high PSA levels can vary by age, race, and other factors: Age \u2013 PSA level tends to increase with age For people in their 40s, a PSA level above 5 ng/mL is very suspicious for disease For those in their 60s, 5 ng/mL or higher is suspicious A PSA level of 10 ng/mL or higher is a danger sign at any age Race \u2013 Normal PSA levels tend to be higher in Black males than in white males\u2014about 1 point higher on

testing People with HIV are at increased risk of developing anal cancer It is important to know your HIV status If you have not been tested for HIV, your provider may recommend that you get tested If you have HIV, getting the care you need may also improve cancer treatment outcomes Gynecologic exam A gynecologic exam, including screening for cervical cancer, is recommended Like anal cancer, HPV is the cause of almost all cervical cancers Cervical cancer screening involves scraping cells from the cervix and testing them for HPV, cancer, and cell changes that may lead to cancer If testing for HPV is not performed, it is simply called a Pap test If the cells are tested for both HPV and cancer, it is called an HPV/Pap co-test MRI You may have an MRI to determine the extent of the cancer in the pelvis MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to make pictures of areas inside the body Unlike a CT scan, MRI does not use radiation Staging The results of testing are used to determine the cancer stage The stage is an assessment of the extent of cancer in the body The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) is used to stage anal cancer This system is used to stage both anal canal and perianal tumors Three key pieces of information are used to determine the stage: T: The size and extent of invasion of the anal tumor Tumors are measured in centimeters (cm) Approximately 2 and a half cm make up one inch N: Whether any lymph nodes near the anus have cancer M: Whether the cancer has metastasized (spread) to areas far from the anus, such as the liver or lungs It is important for the cancer to be staged accurately This helps determine the best treatment plan It also suggests how likely the cancer is to be cured using current treatments Precancer There are abnormal cells on the surface of the anal canal or perianal region These lesions may develop into cancer Names for anal precancer include stage 0 anal cancer, anal dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN), and highgrade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) Treatment may involve close monitoring, electrocautery by an HRA

T1, N0, M Stage II Stage II anal cancer is divided into 2 substages, depending on the size of the tumor Anal tumors larger than 2 cm but not larger than 5 cm are stage IIA This stage is described as

because the symptom burden can feel like an attack on the very nature of the self, including personality changes, language and memory impairment, physical impairment, and poor prognosis.\u201d Grade Another way that gliomas are classified is by grade The grade indicates how quickly the glioma is likely to grow and spread Tumors are graded from 1 to 4 based mostly on how much the tumor cells look like normal cells Low-grade gliomas include grades 1 and High-grade gliomas include grades 3 and Grades are used to predict the outlook (prognosis) of the tumor and to plan treatment Grade 1 tumors grow slowly and are usually benign Many people with grade 1 gliomas can be treated with surgery alone But if the tumor grows back, additional therapy may be given Grade 1 gliomas are more common in children than in adults Grade 2 tumor cells look somewhat abnormal These tumors grow slowly and can invade normal tissue They may not grow back for many years But when they do, they usually come back as a highergrade glioma Grade 3 tumor cells don\u2019t look much like normal cells They quickly increase in number and invade nearby tissue All high-grade tumors (grades 3 and 4) require additional therapy\u2014like radiation and chemotherapy\u2014after surgery Grade 4 tumor cells look very abnormal These tumors grow and spread very quickly Glioblastomas are the most common grade 4 gliomas Biomarkers The neuropathologist also tests the tissue sample for specific biomarkers Biomarker tests provide more details about the glioma tumor A biomarker is something found in the body that\u2019s a sign of a condition, disease, or abnormality In cancer care, biomarker testing looks for changes in genes, proteins, and other markers Many of these changes are mutations A mutation is an abnormal change in your DNA\u2014your body\u2019s genetic instructions A mutation can disrupt how some cells behave, which can cause diseases like cancer Biomarker testing can improve the accuracy of your diagnosis as well as fine-tune your treatment options If testing detects a certain mutation, you might be able to receive treatment that\u2019s targeted more precisely to your glioma Right now, only a few targeted treatments are available for very specific kinds of glioma But researchers are working on hundreds of clinical trials to find more The following biomarkers aren\u2019t the only biomarkers of gliomas, but they\u2019re the most commonly tested Finding these biomarkers (or not finding them) can provide specific information about your glioma See Guide 1 on the next page Ask what biomarker testing is available for your glioma Some hospitals and treatment centers aren\u2019t able to provide a full range of biomarker tests But you can request your tissue to be sent to another lab for

CML? 7 What causes CML? 7 What can you do to get the best care Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is caused by a single, specific abnormal gene that is created when a piece of chromosome 9 and a piece of chromosome 22 break off and trade places The result is a fused gene called BCR::ABL1 and a shortened chromosome 22 called the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome If you do not have the Ph chromosome or the BCR::ABL1 gene, you do not have CML What is CML Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a type of blood cancer Blood is a tissue A tissue is a group of cells that work together to perform a function Blood\u2019s function is to move oxygen and nutrients throughout your body and carry away waste Blood also plays an important role for the immune system and in preventing bleeding There are 4 main components of blood\u2014plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets Types of blood cells Your blood contains different types of cells that float in plasma Plasma is a clear, yellowish fluid made up of mostly water Why you should read this book Making decisions about cancer care can be stressful You may need to make tough decisions under pressure about complex choices NCCN Guidelines for Patients are trusted by patients and providers They clearly explain current care recommendations made by respected experts in the field Recommendations are based on the latest research and practices at leading cancer centers Cancer care is not the same for everyone By following expert recommendations for your situation, you are more likely to improve your care and have better outcomes as a result Use this book as your guide to find the information you need to make important decisions There are 3 types of blood cells: Red blood cells (RBCs or erythrocytes) carry oxygen throughout the body White blood cells (WBCs or leukocytes), which include granulocytes, monocytes, and lymphocytes, fight infections Platelets (PLTs or thrombocytes) help control bleeding In CML, there are usually too many white blood cells (granulocytes) Sometimes, there are too few or too many platelets, as well Chronic means this cancer worsens slowly Granulocytes include: Neutrophils Eosinophils Basophils How are blood cells formed Bone marrow is the sponge-like tissue in the center of most bones Inside your bone marrow are early blood-forming cells called blood (hematopoietic) stem cells All types of blood cells are created from blood stem cells At any given time, the bone marrow will have cells in various stages of development, from very young (immature) to almost fully mature This process is called differentiation Blood stem cells give rise to red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets (PLTs), which are then released into your bloodstream as needed The role of blood stem cells is to make cells called intermediaries that will become red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets These intermediaries are called progenitor cells or precursor cells There are different types of progenitor cells: Lymphoid progenitor cells form into lymphoblasts that mature into lymphocytes Philadelphia chromosome Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is caused by a single, specific abnormal gene that is created when a piece of chromosome 9 and a piece of chromosome 22 break off and trade places The result is a fused gene called BCR::ABL1 and a shortened chromosome 22 called the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome Myeloid progenitor cells form into myeloblasts and other non-lymphoid blood cells Often, in CML the very immature or most immature cells (myeloblasts or lymphoblasts) are referred to simply as blasts CML is thought to arise from blood stem cells that make an increased amount of myeloid progenitor cells However, an advanced form of CML, called blast phase CML (BP-CML), can cause an increased amount of lymphoid or myeloid progenitor cells The type of blast phase cell will affect treatment in BP-CML What causes CML The cause of CML can be traced to a single, specific abnormal gene called BCR::ABLThis fused gene occurs when a piece of chromosome 9 and a piece of chromosome 22 break off and switch places This creates a new, abnormal chromosome 22 that contains a small part of chromosome This new chromosome is referred to as the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) and is the hallmark of CML If you do not have the Ph chromosome or the
